      "Text: Shell has become the latest large company to pull back from carbon offsets amid concerns many have no environmental impact, it has emerged, as the Carbon Trust discontinues its “carbon neutral” labelling scheme based on offsetting. The FTSE 100 oil company, one of the leading proponents of carbon offsetting, abandoned targets to invest up to $100m (£80m) a year in carbon credit schemes and purchase 120m nature offsets a year by 2030 in June, the oil major has confirmed. This is part of what critics argue is a broader watering down of Shell’s climate ambitions. The decision, first reported in Bloomberg, means Shell joins Gucci, Leon, Nestlé and other firms in moving away from offsets amid repeated indications that huge numbers of carbon credits do nothing to mitigate global heating. Earlier this year, the Guardian published an investigation that found that the vast numbers of rainforest carbon offsets were worthless. Shell said it still supported carbon credits and welcomed efforts to improve their quality. The move comes as the Carbon Trust, one of the leading environmental certification schemes, discontinued its “carbon neutral” labelling scheme based on offsets. A director of the trust acknowledged that consumers may have been inadvertently misled by the label due to poor quality offsets. Despite growing scientific evidence that indicates many offsets have no environmental worth the unregulated voluntary carbon market received strong support at this week’s Africa Climate Summit in Nairobi. The Kenyan president, William Ruto, said African countries got nothing for the carbon sinks that serve the world, unveiling new carbon market regulations in his country before the summit. The US climate envoy, John Kerry, told the conference that Africa and the global south would benefit from a growing carbon market. “This market has to become a market in the billions in order to work effectively. For that, we need to ensure the environmental integrity of this market. This is critical, not only to protect the climate, but also to create a thriving market because people won’t take the risk either of getting involved in a market that doesn’t have the right standards and guidelines,” he said. The African Carbon Markets Initiative, announced at Cop27 last year, aims to produce 300m carbon credits annually by 2030, unlocking $6bn (£4.75bn) in revenue, and more than a dozen times that by 2050. At the summit in Kenya, Cop28 hosts the United Arab Emirates (UAE) committed to buying $450m (£360m) of carbon credits from Africa, amid reports the a UAE company is striking deals for large areas of land in anticipation of country to country carbon trading under the Paris agreement. But there is significant concern in Nairobi among environmental campaigners about scaling up carbon markets, and there were protests outside the summit, many raising questions about whether they help local communities or store the carbon they claim. “Rather than providing real and public funding into African renewables and adaptation, this week rich countries pledged money to prop up carbon markets that have never worked, neither in Africa nor elsewhere. They are wasting money that should be spent on real solutions,” said Mohamed Adow, the director of the climate thinktank Power Shift Africa. The unregulated voluntary carbon market, which grew to $2bn in 2021 has since slumped to $500m this year, according to Barclays, but forecasts say the market could reach tens of billions of dollars in the years to come to fund climate change mitigation. In an analyst note this week, the US investment bank Morgan Stanley said the market was facing a reckoning over quality concerns but said the situation would improve as schemes to improve carbon credit integrity had an impact. Speaking to the Guardian, the Carbon Trust director, John Newton, said there was growing regulation on corporate climate change claims around the world, which had prompted the organisation to replace its current labels. “Consumers want more clarity, better explanations, clearer claims and more evidence. We have looked at best practice round the world to help our customers to make sure they are ready for future regulations. That’s the driver [behind dropping the carbon neutral labelling],” he said. “I’ve had lots of conversations with companies. Generally, companies are quite cautious and nervous about the impacts of [offsets]. But they were certainly bought with good intentions. The people we’re working with definitely didn’t go out there thinking these are controversial. I think there was a lot of confidence in the fact that we’re doing the right thing because they come from credible organisations. “I’m not an expert on which offsets are bad and which are good. But obviously, if an offset is found to be not helpful, then yes, I think consumers have been misled. If somebody has an offset that’s not credible, then yes, I recognise that. I can’t speak on behalf of every company but from my experience none of the companies we work with intentionally went and looked for the ones that were risky,” he said. When contacted by the Guardian, a spokesperson for Shell said: “Shell’s position on carbon credits, including from nature-based solutions, remains unchanged. Carbon credits remain a valuable and additional decarbonisation lever in our portfolio, including from nature-based solutions. “The carbon market may not be perfectly functioning everywhere yet, however there are ongoing discussions of how it can be improved which we welcome; that is how markets progress.”  This article was amended on 11 and 12 September 2023 to clarify that Shell itself did not say that abandoning targets to invest up to $100m a year in carbon credit schemes and purchase 120m nature offsets a year by 2030 were part of a programme to water down Shell’s climate ambitions.

      "Text: A cross-party group of influential politicians has urged Rishi Sunak to set an example by attending the UN climate summit this November, as both major parties come under pressure over their net-zero policies. The group of MPs and peers wants him to commit to attending Cop28 in Dubai, and to appoint a secretary of state as special envoy for the climate ahead of the UN general assembly in September, where preparations will be made for Cop28. “The UK has an important role to play in leveraging its international influence, and working constructively with all [countries], to help secure an agreed package that clearly names the requirement to phase out all fossil fuels and set goals for the upscaling of renewables,” they wrote, in a letter from the all-party parliamentary group for climate, seen by the Guardian. “Working to guarantee a successful outcome at Cop28 is not just essential for the health of people and the planet, but economically the right thing for Britain. As the Office for Budget Responsibility advised, continuing to rely on gas at the current level will come at double the cost of transitioning to net zero. “As you were recently warned by top energy companies, backing away from green policies would be catastrophic for the economy.” Zac Goldsmith, a former Tory minister who resigned last month, blaming Sunak for his failure to lead on green issues, is the most prominent Conservative among the 23 signatories, which also include the former Labour minister Hilary Benn, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, Daisy Cooper, and the outgoing Green party MP Caroline Lucas. Lord Randall, the former environment advisor to Theresa May, is among the Tories signing, and there were two Scottish National party signatories. Sunak has faced calls from sections of his party and the media to row back on green commitments after the Tory victory in the Uxbridge byelection last Thursday, where concerns over the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) were judged to be a significant factor. The prime minister said on Monday that green policies must be “proportionate and pragmatic”. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has been urged not to retreat on his climate and environment proposals after pledging to “reflect” after the Uxbridge result. The letter called on Sunak to reject the Rosebank oilfield in the North Sea, which experts have found would do almost nothing for the UK’s energy security but would add substantially to greenhouse gas emissions. The letter also called for a reaffirmation of the government’s commitment to halt deforestation by 2030. Benn, a former environment secretary under Gordon Brown, pointed to a recent report from the climate change committee that found the UK had lost its international leadership on the climate through a series of policy failures. “The journey to a net-zero Britain offers permanent energy affordability and new economic opportunities across our regions. The country is crying out for this type of change,” Benn said. “Rishi Sunak must heed our advice and get on with the job. Otherwise, Britain will be left behind in the global race to a clean-energy world.”\n",

      "Text: The leaking oil tanker Prestige sank today off Spain's north-western coast, taking more than 70,000 tonnes of fuel into the Atlantic with it. A spokesman for Smit International, the Dutch salvage company attempting to rescue the Prestige, told the Reuters news agency: \"The aft [rear] part of the ship has sunk. The front part is still floating but it will sink ... A lot of oil went down with this [aft] part.\" The spokesman said winds and currents would determine whether more oil reached the coast. The Bahamas-flagged Prestige, which began spilling oil last Wednesday, split in half this morning about 152 miles off Spain's Galician coast. Environmentalists had warned that if the ship sank it would cause an ecological catastrophe twice the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster off Alaska. Smit spokeswoman Claudia Van Andel said the vessel had been disconnected from the salvage tugs. The salvage company estimated that the tanker had lost between 1.3 million gallons and 2.6 million gallons of fuel so far. Ms Van Andel said there was a chance some of the oil compartments could remain intact and plunge the 3,600 metres to the sea floor, moderating the spill damage. \"A lot depends on the temperature of the sea. If it drops low enough, the oil could become a solid mass and is not so dangerous,\" Ms Van Andel said. She added that there was little likelihood any of the ship or its cargo could be salvaged. The Prestige ran into trouble during a violent storm last Wednesday. Already the disaster has led to the spillage of some 5,000 tonnes of fuel oil near one of Spain's richest fisheries. The government has warned that the oil spilled so far could seep down into the many inlets that characterise the Galician coast. On Monday, the salvage company tried to prevent the tanker from splitting by turning it so that its ruptured hull no longer faced the waves. The ship lies roughly on the borderline of areas for which Spain and Portugal have responsibility for maritime rescue operations. Portugal and Spain had barred salvagers from towing the ship to any of their ports to protect their fishing and tourism industries from further damage. Last night Smit International began an attempt to tow the Prestige towards Africa. A spokesman for the company had said it would keep the tanker heading south until it found somewhere it could attempt a transfer of the cargo, but admitted that that probably would not happen until the tanker got to Africa. Environmentalists had demanded that the Prestige should be bombed and burned before it is allowed to sink. \"If it sinks to the bottom it could still be the worst environmental disaster we have ever seen,\" warned Miguel Angel Valladares of the Spanish branch of the WWF, formerly the World Wide Fund for Nature. In a twist that threatens to exacerbate the Anglo-Spanish row over Gibraltar, Spain has blamed Britain for the disaster, claiming the ageing London-insured ship had been heading for Gibraltar because it did not meet EU security regulations to dock at any other European port.\n",

      "Text: Waste fish parts will be used to power ships in a new initiative to use green energy for polluting cruise liners. The leftovers of fish processed for food and mixed with other organic waste will be used to generate biogas, which will then be liquefied and used in place of fossil fuels by the expedition cruise line Hurtigruten. Heavy fossil fuels used by ocean-going transport are an increasing problem as they are even more polluting than fuels for land-based vehicles, emitting sulphur and other contaminants. The fuels contribute to air pollution as well as to climate change. Converting vessels to use biogas will cut down on pollutants and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hurtigruten operates a fleet of 17 ships, and by 2021 aims to have converted at least six of its vessels to use biogas, liquefied natural gas – a fossil fuel, but cleaner than many alternatives – and large battery packs, capable of storing energy produced from renewable sources. The 125-year-old company, based in Norway, is also banning single-use plastics in an effort to be more environmentally sustainable. It operates cruises in the Arctic and Antarctic, both highly sensitive environments. Biogas can be generated from most forms of organic waste by speeding up and harnessing the natural decomposition process to capture the methane produced. Organic waste is produced by all food industries but is frequently disposed of in landfill, where it contributes to greenhouse gas emissions as it decomposes. Shipping has come under increasing scrutiny as many vessels use heavy fuel oil, which is cheap but would be banned on land for its polluting qualities. The daily greenhouse gas emissions from the world’s largest cruise liners can be as great as those of a million cars on the road. Battery power is also a promising technology for ocean-going transport, but building batteries powerful enough has been a problem to date. Advances in battery manufacture are making it possible to install batteries big enough to last a voyage. Hurtigruten is currently building three new hybrid-powered cruise ships in Norway, to be delivered in the next three years. Daniel Skjeldam, the chief executive of Hurtigruten, said: “Norway is a large shipping nation, but fishery and forestry are also large sectors. They create jobs and produce income, but they also produce a lot of waste products. The steady access to high volumes of organic waste gives the Nordic countries a unique position on the biogas market. We are pushing for more innovation, more investment. I believe we have just seen the beginning of what in a few years will be a huge sector.”\n",

      "Text: Populations of bees, butterflies and other species important for agricultural pollination are declining, posing potential risks to major world crops, a UN body on biodiversity said Friday.   “Many wild bees and butterflies have been declining in abundance, occurrence and diversity at local and regional scales in Northwest Europe and North America,” said an assessment by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).   It said declines had also been detected elsewhere in the world and that possible causes include habitat loss, pesticides, pollution, invasive species, pathogens and climate change. The report by the IPBES, which was established under UN auspices in 2012 to assess the state of ecosystems and biodiversity, stopped short of declaring a full-scale threat to food supplies. But it stressed the importance of protecting pollinators to ensure stable fruit and vegetable output, amid concern over the challenge of feeding the world’s growing population in coming decades. It said animal pollination is directly responsible for between 5-8% of global agricultural production by volume, amounting to between $235bn (£167bn) and $577bn worth of annual output. In addition, more than three-quarters of the “leading types of global food crops” rely to some extent on animal pollination for yield and quality. “Pollinator-dependent species encompass many fruit, vegetable, seed, nut and oil crops, which supply major proportions of micronutrients, vitamins, and minerals in the human diet,” the IPBES said. Pollination is the transfer of pollen between the male and female parts of flowers to enable reproduction. The assessment is the work of nearly 80 scientists from around the world and was released at an IPBES meeting in Kuala Lumpur. It is the first report by the four-year-old group, which is considered the biodiversity equivalent of the UN-organised Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In Europe, 9% of bee and butterfly species are threatened with extinction and populations are declining for 37% of bee species and 31% of butterfly species for which sufficient data is available, the IPBES said. In some places in Europe more than 40% of bee species may be threatened, it added. A “data gap” frustrates analysis of the situation in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, but the same drivers are suspected to be at work in those regions, it said. Data is more solid for non-insect pollinators such as bats and birds, however, with the IPBES saying 16% of such species worldwide are threatened with extinction. Some of the most important world food staples such as rice, wheat and other grains do not rely on animal pollination. But vulnerable crops could include apples, mangoes, chocolate and many other commonly consumed foods, said Simon Potts, co-chair of the assessment. “Pretty much nearly all your fruits and many of your vegetables are pollination-dependent,” said Potts, deputy director of the Centre for Agri-Environmental Research at Britain’s Reading University. Possible policy options include better protection of natural environments and ecosystems, limiting the scope of intensive agriculture, and finding alternatives to pesticides, the IPBES said. Greater attention to controlling pathogens among species and better regulation of managed populations of bees and other pollinators could also help, it added. IPBES members stressed that the group does not make specific recommendations, but provides information for policy-makers. The assessment said pollinator declines could lead to lower crop yields, raising prices for consumers and reducing agricultural profits.\n",

      "Text: The energy secretary, Ed Davey, has forced through approval for a giant incineration plant in the constituency of chancellor, in the latest skirmish between the Department for Energy and the Treasury. George Osborne was first to sign 25,000-strong petition against building in Cheshire an energy-from-waste plant that will devour 600,000 tonnes of rubbish every year. But Davey gave final approval for the plan on 2 October, leaving a high court challenge as the only remaining option for the chancellor and fellow opponents. \"I campaigned hard against the incinerator and am, therefore, naturally disappointed with the decision,\" he told constituents, many of whom were enraged by the decision. Brian Cartwright, chair of the Cheshire against Incinerators group, said: \"This news is devastating for those who live in Northwich and the surrounding area, particularly because the government has clearly not listened to the people who are united in their opposition. It exposes the doctrine of 'localism' as a cynical confidence trick.\" A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) said: \"It is essential we have a balanced energy mix in the future to provide low cost, efficient energy. This plant takes waste and turns it into something of great value and in addition creates jobs for the local community.\" He added that a full and detailed public inquiry had recommended approval, after hearing evidence about all aspects of the development, including potential health, traffic and visual impacts. Osborne, who told the Tory party conference this week he would be \"a relentless activist [for] building infrastructure, roads and power plants\", has opposed the incinerator plan at Lostock Gralam, near Northwich, for many years. In April 2008, he declared victory: \"Our campaign has been a resounding success. We have stopped the incinerator being built in Lostock Gralam. I will continue to fight to make sure the plans don't come back.\" The plant is being built by E.on and Tata Chemicals Europe on the site of a former coal-fired power station. It will provide power for Tata's nearby chemicals plant, which Osborne once praised as an \"important local employer\". In a further embarrassment for him, Martin Ashcroft, Tata Chemicals Europe managing director, blamed \"ever-rising gas prices which are increasingly difficult to absorb\" as the reason for the incinerator. Osborne has pushed a renewed \"dash for gas\" as the solution to Britain's energy problems, describing the fuel as \"cheap\" in his budget speech. The role of gas, as well as renewable energy, are at the heart of his dispute with Davey. But urgent efforts are being made to resolve the row. A senior Conservative source told the Guardian that David Cameron is now personally re-engaging with the green agenda, recognising it as one of the few growing parts of the economy. There will be a meeting of the all-powerful coalition quad – Cameron, Osborne, Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander – in the next week, the source said: \"The PM wants to bring the Treasury and Decc on to the same page. The Treasury has to sign up to the renewable energy agenda, while Decc has to reassure on costs.\"\n",

      "Text: Professor Colin Green (Letters, 7 September) makes a classic first-world myopic error in believing that the rise in human population is mainly responsible for the impending ecological crisis. It is not numbers of people per se damaging the planet, but frenetic consumption in the wealthy world that lies behind anthropogenic climate change. You can curb family sizes in poor countries all you like – if you have the moral stomach for such gross colonialism and denial of essential human freedoms – but the ecological crisis will remain as long as we live the way we do in the rich world. As Pope Francis puts it in his ecological teaching document, Laudato Si’: “To blame population growth instead of extreme and selective consumerism on the part of some, is one way of refusing to face the issues. It is an attempt to legitimise the present model of distribution, where a minority believes that it has the right to consume in a way which can never be universalised, since the planet could not even contain the waste products of such consumption.” He does not, however, deny population is a factor in the environment, noting that “attention needs to be paid to imbalances in population density, on both national and global levels, since a rise in consumption would lead to complex regional situations”. But the general point is clear: you do not heal the damage to the planet by eliminating the poor. As Francis says: “a true ecological approach always becomes a social approach; it must integrate questions of justice in debates on the environment, so as to hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor.”Dr Austen IvereighCoordinator, Catholic Voices  While I am enthused by Pope Francis’s recent calls for environmental destruction to be classified as a sin (Report, 1 September), I do wonder if a more nuanced perspective is required. Is it right to classify certain behaviours that cause ecological harm as sin, if there is a lack of knowledge, capacity and choice to take alternative, more environmentally friendly courses of action? For example, is it fair to say I have sinned if I have to drive my gas-guzzling car in the city because of an absence of safe and coordinated cycle infrastructure? Is it fair to say I have sinned if I have to deal with the vast amounts of waste forced upon me by retailers? Or if I depend on oil because alternatives are not provided, or are too expensive? Perhaps the sin lies not with the individual, but instead with the failure by government and policymakers to adequately inform on the issues, and provide structures and incentives for pro-environmental behaviour.Catherine DevittJesuit Centre for Faith and Justice, Dublin   Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n",

      "Text: Last month a Nasa data scientist, Peter Kalmus, chained himself to the entrance doors of the JP Morgan Chase building in Los Angeles. A video of a short speech he gave about global heating before he was arrested was shared multiple times on social media. In the clip, voice faltering, he told the public: “I’m here because scientists are not being listened to … we are going to lose everything and we are not joking.” He spoke to the Observer in a personal capacity. What drove you to nonviolent protest?It’s this mounting feeling that I need to do more. I have a sense of desperation, because of the wide gulf between what the science says society needs to do and how it feels like everything is heading in the opposite direction. World leaders and people not understanding that we’re in an emergency. Then the question comes to me, if I’m sitting with the science every day, and I want to protect my kids and young people and non-humans, what do I do? I’ve been on this 16-year journey trying to answer that question, and civil disobedience seemed like something good to try. I’m ashamed to say that it took me this long. Do you think more scientists should be talking directly to the public about how they feel?Oh, absolutely. Because we’re not just brains in a vat, we’re humans. The reason oceanologists, ecologists and climate scientists are studying these living systems is because they deeply love them and care about them. Uniformly, across the board, they’re all seeing these massive declines and they’re seeing these systems dying in front of their eyes. I know they’re feeling strong emotions. Civil disobedience has been far more effective at communicating urgency than anything else I’ve tried. Last week the UK Met Office said there was a 50% chance that in one of the next five years, 1.5C of warming will be breached. The aviation industry was found to have met only one of 50 climate targets. And a Guardian investigative report revealed that fossil fuel companies are planning huge “carbon bomb” projects that will drive climate catastrophe. That’s a pretty standard week in the global heating news cycle…This has been just ramping up and ramping up over the years. It’s only going to get more intense as we go forward. That’s why I feel this desperation to end the fossil fuel industry as quickly as possible. Ending the fossil fuel industry is the main thing we need to do to take the pressure off the Earth system and to at least start to stabilise at where we’re at. Then, these news stories will likely start to stabilise as well. But yeah, it’s getting more intense, isn’t it? That’s where we’re at now. That’s a normal week for 2022. What is 2024 going to be like? What’s 2025 going to be like? The mean temperature on the planet keeps going up with every tonne of fossil fuel we burn. At some point you’re going to surpass all of these different milestones. It’s no secret that the fossil fuel industry has been planning to make as much profit as they can from extracting and selling fossil fuel, no matter what happens to the planet, to us, and to future generations. I don’t think we should just talk about future generations any more, because people are dying right now, all around the world. That’s going to happen more as we approach deadly humid heat thresholds in certain regions that the human body can’t actually live through. It’s diabolical that these industrialists wish to take short-term profits at the expense of literally everything. Are the agreements and pledges made at Cop meetings sufficient or effective? Last week the Guardian ran a story revealing how few of the pledges have been acted on…The esteemed climate scientist Michael Mann, right after Cop26, wrote an op-ed […arguing that] Cop26 was not a failure. I wrote an op-ed the next day saying that it was absolutely a failure, and that it’s very dangerous not to recognise it as a failure, because that, again, decreases the urgency of dealing with the problem. If we consider that as not a failure, what happened at Cop26, then the public can sort of have this feeling that the “people in charge” are doing what they need to do, which is absolutely not the case. They’re not doing what they need to do. The fossil fuel industry has deeply penetrated politics and even the Cop process itself. It will do everything it can to throw a monkey wrench in the works and to delay action. It’s up to the leaders of the world to stand up to that and to say: “A livable planet is more important than your profits. We are not going to allow this process of delay to continue.” What worries me is that, in this critical year between Cop26 and Cop27, every signal that we’re getting from world leaders is that fossil fuels will continue to expand. President Biden is begging Opec to expand production. He’s opening new lands for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and public lands of the US. Right now, what I’m seeing from world leaders, including Biden, is that they’re using the bully pulpit of their position to urge the expansion of fossil fuels. They’ve completely stopped talking about taking climate action. The effects of the Ukraine war on energy prices offer a golden opportunity for massive investment in renewable energy and phasing out fossil fuels. But the political class doesn’t see it that way…The leaders of the world are squandering a historic opportunity to make that transition to renewables. Instead, they’re using it as an opportunity to expand the fossil fuel industry, and the fossil fuel CEOs are rubbing their hands in glee at what’s happening right now. They can’t believe their good fortune that Putin invaded Ukraine. Can you explain the stranglehold that the fossil fuel industry has over the American political system? Sometimes, as an outsider, you see the wildfires on the west coast, you see that Florida is sinking, and it doesn’t make sense…There’s this kind of equilibrium of corruption that has developed. They know which politicians’ campaigns to support for maximum return on their investment. For them, it’s a tiny investment. Then, somehow they’ve also managed to capture the media. They certainly have the Fox News network on their side, but somehow, even the non-conservative side hasn’t been reporting the story as it should, that this is an emergency for the planet. The public don’t sense any urgency from the media. Therefore, the politicians that are taking these campaign donations from the fossil fuel industry are not being held to account. It runs deeper doesn’t it? The right to drive wherever and whenever is part of the American dream, any politician who challenges that gets massive pushback. The price of gas or petrol is an emotive issue.Three-quarters of global heating is caused by burning fossil fuels. Everything else we talk about – planting trees, carbon captures, carbon offsets – is just rearranging deckchairs. The thing we’ve got to do to avoid hitting the iceberg is to end the fossil fuel industry as quickly as we can. The problem with not protecting the interest of the working class as we make this transition is that they would effectively rise up against any climate policies that made their lives unlivable because of high energy costs. We saw that happen a few years ago with the gilets jaunes [yellow vests] in France. The only way we can get the working class on board is if the transition away from fossil fuels is effectively subsidised by the ultra rich, which means there does need to be a redistribution of wealth. You are talking about systematic change leading to a new economic system. When people hear that, they hear “degrowth”. They feel it’s going to impact their standard of living.People need to understand that all degrowth really is, is a switch in the goal of the economic system. We need to change the goal of the system from the accumulation of capital to the flourishing of all people, not just people in the global north, also people in the global south, and the flourishing of all life on this planet, because our economic system is embedded in the biosphere. If we take down the biosphere, we lose everything, and we don’t have an economic system any more. That’s why we desperately need to change the goal of the system to the flourishing of everyone and all life on the planet. But many individuals like driving, flying and eating beef. They feel the climate movement wants to take away things they enjoy…They do. There’s different kinds of pleasure in life, right? Like getting deeply involved in your community, or feeling like you’re involved in something deeply meaningful, like humanity getting on a better course and the future being better for your children. I would argue that, through my experience, those kinds of pleasures are actually more sustaining. They’re deeply satisfying. They’re less superficial. But yeah, I know that it’s a hard sell. It almost takes a spiritual practice to be able to kind of come out of the addictions of modern life, which are very enticing. That was the reason that I wrote my book [about reducing his carbon footprint by 90%], because I wanted to get the message out that there’s actually a lot of pleasure in making these kinds of changes. I didn’t know whether it would resonate with people or not. It turned out to resonate with a much smaller fraction of people than I expected. Is there anyone in American politics that you look to, or a generation of younger representatives who might be able to articulate and sell this kind of vision?Not really, no, it’s pretty bleak. Bernie Sanders, he’s not young, but he was the closest one that I ever saw to articulating this vision. Just understanding that we’re at risk of losing everything. He would say things like: “I know my climate plan is expensive, but what’s the alternative?” We have to do whatever it takes to save this planet. Because if we degrade the life support systems of this planet, we effectively lose everything. We’re going down this very dangerous slide and we don’t know exactly how far down it takes before we lose X, or before we lose Y, or before this system on the planet breaks down. But we know that the further down we slide, the more we’re going to start going past those sort of collapse points. Bernie Sanders got that. I’ve never seen anything that Joe Biden has said or done to convince me that he understands that. I don’t think he understands what grave danger we’re all in. Why don’t you run for office, Peter?Then, I’d have to stop being a scientist. There was a new poll where only 42% of Americans thought that climate change was a “very serious problem” – less than half of Americans. That’s a huge problem for electoral politics. 42% – that’s almost a half-full glass. Only a few more percent, you’re in business.I will say that whichever elected leader makes climate action their top priority and stops the degradation of Earth, they will be remembered by history as one of the most visionary leaders of all time. Nothing could be more clear to me than that. I do think there’s a way to sell this kind of stuff I’m saying to the American people. Because the jobs that will be created are a tremendous economic opportunity. There’s an incredible amount of stuff that we need to build, at least initially. We have to build alternative infrastructure, so that we can feed ourselves, and we can clothe ourselves, and we can transport ourselves without fossil fuels. Do you feel your own mental health is suffering, because you’re so fluent in the data and the politics of global heating?I’m constantly fending off this sort of ocean of climate anxiety that’s in my brain. When that ocean rises to a high enough level, I can’t really function any more. I get stressed. I am not very fun to be around. My ability to write degrades hugely. The strongest practice I have to keep that ocean of anxiety at bay is a meditation practice, called Vipassana. It takes two hours a day to do this practice. It takes a 10-day silent retreat once a year to kind of build up the batteries. But if I’m doing it, then I have zero climate anxiety. I’m fully aware of the emergency, but it unlocks my ability to be able to do everything I can, to work as hard as I can to sound the alarm, basically. I used to take vacations in the High Sierra, to kind of recharge through nature, but it doesn’t work any more. Because last summer we took a five-day backpacking trip up there with my younger son and my partner, the three of us. It was too depressing to me, because in the two years that I’d walked on that trail, the John Muir trail, the tree mortality was just outrageous. There were so many dead trees all along the path. Streams and ponds that had once been flowing at that time of year, two years earlier, were bone dry, because of the drought. I can’t go. It’s just too painful for me now. When I’m in the mountains, I’m constantly feeling climate grief. That’s not a way for me to deal with my climate anxiety any more, unfortunately. Do you understand why some younger people are deciding not to have children, because of the climate crisis?If I were in their place, I would also choose not to have children. It’s a hard thing to say. It’s so heartbreaking to have this sense that the future is getting worse, and that it’s going to be worse for your kids. Now it feels like it’s getting worse at a very fast rate. One thing I desperately want before I die is to have a feeling that the future is going to be better. That we’ve switched this corner and we’ve started to change the system towards flourishing for all, and we’ve come out of this madness of billionaires, and fossil fuel, and money in politics. That’s what I want to feel. I’ll feel grief from maybe the loss of the Amazon rainforest, and the loss of most of the world’s coral reefs, but mixed with that grief, I long for a feeling of solidarity. I long to feel a faith in humanity once again, because right now I’m not so sure. There’s some tremendous people out there, but it feels like, as a species, we’re just on autopilot and we’re not making the right decisions. I long to feel that we’re doing things better.  This article was amended on 23 May 2022 to remove part of a comment about Michael Mann’s op-ed after Cop26. Peter Kalmus described the piece as having “proclaimed victory” for the summit in arguing that it had not been a failure. While the op-ed pointed to some “real progress” and grounds for hope, it did not go so far as to declare Cop26 a victory. The article was also amended to correct a transcription error: Kalmus referred to “deadly humid heat”, not “deadly human heat” as we said in an earlier version.\n",

The decision, published late Friday, follows an 18-month review of the original determination which ordered Jam Land to restore 103 hectares of grasslands on a property in the New South Wales Monaro region. It comes more than five years after the company poisoned the grasslands, known as the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands, on a property in Corrowong. Richard Taylor, one of Jam Land’s directors, said the company was considering whether it would appeal the decision in the federal court and accused the department of agriculture, water and environment of sitting on the outcome for the past nine months. “We’re obviously very disappointed but also annoyed that the department, having sat on this for nine months, have delivered it to us two weeks before Christmas and we’ve only got 28 days to lodge an appeal with the federal court,” he said. “We would like to do that but we’ve just got to make sure we can resource it. “For us, it’s a matter of principle.” In May last year, Jam Land sought a ministerial review of the federal environment department’s determination that the company illegally cleared about 30 hectares of the grasslands in late October 2016. The original determination ordered the company to undertake restoration work – including weed management, erecting stock-proof fences and avoiding broad-acre application of herbicides or fertilisers – on a separate area of the property to the cleared land. Angus Taylor is a shareholder in Jam Land, via his family company Gufee. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Jam Land investigation has been controversial because Angus Taylor sought meetings with senior environment officials about the grasslands while it was under way. The office of the then environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, subsequently sought advice about whether laws protecting the grasslands could be changed. A delegate to the environment minister, Sussan Ley, upheld the original decision in the case on Friday. The statement said the initial investigation found the poison had a significant impact on the critically endangered grasslands. Clearing without first seeking approval carries a maximum penalty of $11m for a body corporate. “In responding to the contravention of the Act, a delegate to the minister made a remediation determination, requiring Jam Land as the landholder to mitigate the damage by managing and enhancing the natural ecological values of 103 hectares of native grasslands on the property,” the statement says. It is the first time in the history of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act that a ministerial review of a remediation order has been sought. Richard Taylor said the company believed it had undertaken a best practice environmental assessment when it commissioned an ecologist to assess the property before the clearing in 2016. That assessment was done in accordance with the relevant state legislation, he said, and the broader community had been unaware the grasslands were also listed under federal laws. Taylor said the department had not consulted the community about the listing, something the department disputes. In a briefing released to Guardian Australian under freedom of information laws in 2019, department officials wrote there had been public consultation at the time of the original listing in the 2000s and again when it was upgraded to critically endangered in 2016. The latter had exceeded the statutory requirements of the Act and included emails to councils, local land services and the National Farmers’ Federation and NSW Farmers Association. Taylor said as a result of the assessment of the property, Jam Land had fenced off a larger, separate area that was identified as having high conservation value and managed it for conservation “at our own expense and we’ve had no credit for that”. He said about 30 to 40% of his land holdings in the Monaro region were being managed for conservation and this was also typical of other farmers. “The way the department is behaving, that goodwill has just vaporised not only for us but throughout the district,” Taylor said. He said he was unhappy with the way the department had handled the investigation with multiple delays since it was referred to them five years ago. “They’ve strung this out I believe for political purposes. It’s been very politically charged,” he said. A department spokesperson said the matter was complex in nature and “the department considered the issues raised by Jam Land to enable the delegate to determine whether to affirm, vary or set aside the determination to ensure natural justice was provided.” The spokesperson said the department sought Jam Land’s engagement throughout the process and the decision to affirm the remediation order was made in accordance with compliance policy. A Guardian Australia investigation in 2019 revealed Angus Taylor met with senior environment officials and the office of the former environment minister Josh Frydenberg in March 2017 about the listing of the grasslands while the investigation was under way. Frydenberg’s office sought advice from his department about whether protection for the grasslands could be weakened in secret. Departmental emails also showed Frydenberg sought urgent information about the investigation after it was raised in parliament by an unnamed person. Angus Taylor has repeatedly stated that he sought the meeting with departmental officials on behalf of constituents in Hume who were concerned about the grasslands listing. He has previously said “I did not make any representations to federal or state authorities in relation to any compliance action being undertaken.” A spokesperson for the department of environment and energy said officials “did not discuss the compliance matter with Taylor”. Both Taylor and Frydenberg have said the meeting was focused on the “technical aspects” of the grasslands listing. Comment was sought from Angus Taylor.\n",

      "Text: Climate change is full of surprises. We were warned about heatwaves, hurricanes and high-intensity firestorms. What we didn’t see coming was a cynical, cyclical economy of blackout bullshit. As climate impacts intensify, power grids stuffed with ageing fossil fuel infrastructure crumble. Those blackouts are usually blamed on wind and solar – and used to extend the lifespan of existing fossil fuel generators. Opportunity costs increase, climate impacts worsen and blackouts intensify. It’s an accelerating death spiral. Last week Texas suffered an outage likely to be the worst on record in the US. Millions of people were without power for days, initially at a scale roughly equivalent to all of eastern Australia going dark at once. A burst of winter weather froze vital components at power stations, gas supplies were limited by frozen pipelines and, consequently, a third of the state’s thermal power stations were offline (mostly gas). An unspecified proportion of wind turbines were disabled due to icing and low-temperature shutoffs, but “gas and coal were actually the biggest culprits in the crisis”, Eric Fell, director of North America gas at Wood Mackenzie, told Bloomberg. Regardless, windfarms copped the blame. “Icy weather chills Texas wind energy as deep freeze grips much of US,” was one Reuters headline. “Frozen Turbines and Surging Demand Prompt Rolling Blackouts in Texas,” wrote the New York Times. “The windmills froze, so the power grid failed,” said Tucker Carlson of Fox News. Fox blamed renewables for the blackouts 128 times over two days. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, said: “This shows how the Green New Deal would be a deadly deal.” He was joined by the Republicans Ted Cruz, Dan Crenshaw and Lauren Boebert, each seizing on the crisis to attack renewables (most of them on the receiving end of eye-watering sums from fossil industry). The narrative was confused. An image of a helicopter de-icing a wind turbine (taken from a 2015 test in Sweden) was falsely presented as if it were in Texas. They were simultaneously frozen but also freed by helicopters (how ironic!). The details didn’t matter; the goal was filling the initial information vacuum with narrative-setting imagery and words. It was a note-for-note repeat of the 2016 blackout in South Australia, in which the entire state’s power supply was knocked out during a freak storm. The event was immediately blamed on wind power by conservative politicians and media. Though wind’s role in the sequence of events related to an immediately rectified software setting, it was presented as proof the technology would bring darkness to Australia, as I wrote in my book digging into the technical, cultural and political detail of that pivotal moment. Since then, South Australia’s renewable energy growth has slowly but surely continued. Clean energy has gone from 40% to 60% of generation, and the remaining gas fleet is shrinking. And Australia’s market operator has published scenarios examining how the state could grow to about 90% without any impact on reliability: These strides are impressive but at a national level far too slow to hit grid emissions reductions aligned with a 1.5C target – essentially, near-zero emissions electric power by about 2030. That goal requires coal and gas plants shutting down well before their scheduled retirement age; a conversation still plagued by blackout scaremongering. Meanwhile, Australia’s coal and gas plants are failing catastrophically during increasingly intense heatwaves. Even the prospect of the next coal plant closing on time was opposed on the grounds that it would bring South Australia-style blackouts. Australia’s prime minister threatened to build a 1,000MW gas-fired power station using public money as a sort of punishment for a perceived lack of firm power, despite the grid operator’s own forecasts confirming that new renewables would more than offset the plant’s shutdown. Though Australia’s renewable industry is making strides, investment is slowing. Unless the baggage of 2016 is shaken off, decarbonisation will be rate-limited. The era of blackout bullshit is a pincer movement of worsening climate impacts on one side and ageing fossil infrastructure on the other, with pro-fossil misinformation firestorms burning through algorithmically intensified conservative media and social networks. The intensifiers of climate impacts, such as grids crumbling under deregulation and free market ideology, do not get the prominence they deserve. The technical details of integrating wind and solar are ignored. It is a wall of exhausting, unstoppable noise. The US renewable sector, the backbone of Biden’s 2035 100% clean electricity plan, could end up struggling up an already-steep hill hit by frequent and aggressive blackout bullshit campaigns. “We can’t have another Texas” will be the catchcry. Malcolm Turnbull’s “Blackout Bill [Shorten]” could end up repurposed for Biden. It can be avoided. The benefits of renewable energy must be spread far more broadly, through programs such as community ownership and investment. Climate jobs must be real, rich and diversified. Deeper efforts to fight misinformation, including from traditional media outlets, must be made. And climate resilience must be baked into every plan to transition. Decarbonisation must go faster, and it can, with a full awareness of the threat of a fossil fuel death spiral.\n",

      "Text: The first science-based diet that tackles both the poor food eaten by billions of people and averts global environmental catastrophe has been devised. It requires huge cuts in red meat-eating in western countries and radical changes across the world. The “planetary health diet” was created by an international commission seeking to draw up guidelines that provide nutritious food to the world’s fast-growing population. At the same time, the diet addresses the major role of farming – especially livestock – in driving climate change, the destruction of wildlife and the pollution of rivers and oceans. Globally, the diet requires red meat and sugar consumption to be cut by half, while vegetables, fruit, pulses and nuts must double. But in specific places the changes are stark. North Americans need to eat 84% less red meat but six times more beans and lentils. For Europeans, eating 77% less red meat and 15 times more nuts and seeds meets the guidelines. The diet is a “win-win”, according to the scientists, as it would save at least 11 million people a year from deaths caused by unhealthy food, while preventing the collapse of the natural world that humanity depends upon. With 10 billion people expected to live on Earth by 2050, a continuation of today’s unsustainable diets would inevitably mean even greater health problems and severe global warming. Unhealthy diets are the leading cause of ill health worldwide, with 800 million people currently hungry, 2 billion malnourished and further 2 billion people overweight or obese. The world’s science academies recently concluded that the food system is broken. Industrial agriculture is also devastating the environment, as forests are razed and billions of cattle emit climate-warming methane. “The world’s diets must change dramatically,” said Walter Willett at Harvard University and one of the leaders of the commission convened by the Lancet medical journal and the Eat Forum NGO. The report, published in the Lancet and being launched to policymakers in 40 cities around the world, also concluded that food waste must be halved to 15%. “Humanity now poses a threat to the stability of the planet,” said Prof Johan Rockström at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, Sweden, another author of the report. “[This requires] nothing less than a new global agricultural revolution.” Farm yields in poorer nations must be improved to create a sustainable, healthy world, the report found. The planetary health diet is largely plant-based and allows an average of 2,500 calories a day. It allows one beef burger and two servings of fish a week, but most protein comes from pulses and nuts. A glass of milk a day, or some cheese or butter, fits within the guidelines, as does an egg or two a week. Half of each plate of food under the diet is vegetables and fruit, and a third is wholegrain cereals. Willett said these provide the ingredients for a flexible and varied diet: “We are not talking about a deprivation diet here; we are talking about a way of eating that can be healthy, flavourful and enjoyable. “The numbers for red meat sound small to a lot of people in the UK or US,” he said. “But they don’t sound small to the very large part of the world’s population that already consumes about that much or even less. It is very much in line with traditional diets.” The planetary health diet resembles those already known to be healthy, such as the Mediterranean or Okinawa diets, the researchers said. “The planetary health diet is based on really hard epidemiological evidence, where researchers followed large cohorts of people for decades,” said Marco Springmann at Oxford University and part of the commission. “It so happens that if you put all that evidence together you get a diet that looks similar to some of the healthiest diets that exist in the real world.” The report acknowledges the radical change it advocates and the difficulty of achieving it: “Humanity has never aimed to change the global food system on the scale envisioned. Achieving this goal will require rapid adoption of numerous changes and unprecedented global collaboration and commitment: nothing less than a Great Food Transformation.” But it notes that major global changes have occurred before, such as the Green Revolution that hugely increased food supplies in the 1960s. Moves to tax red meat, prevent the expansion of farmland and protect swathes of ocean must all be considered, the commission said. Prof Guy Poppy, from the UK’s University of Southampton, and not part of the commission, said: “This ‘call to arms’ with its clear solutions is timely, comprehensively researched and deserves immediate attention.” “This analysis is the most advanced ever conducted,” said Prof Alan Dangour, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and also not part of the team. “But there is a major question about the ability of populations to shift to such dietary recommendations and their wider public acceptability.” Prof Nigel Scollan, at Queen’s University Belfast and part of the industry-backed Meat Advisory Panel, said: “This report tells us what we have known for millennia: an omnivorous diet is optimal. In the UK, encouraging people to eat less red meat and dairy will have little impact on the environment and is potentially damaging to people’s health.” But Richard Horton and Tamara Lucas, editors at the Lancet, said in an editorial that global changes as set out by the planetary health diet were essential: “Civilisation is in crisis. We can no longer feed our population a healthy diet while balancing planetary resources. If we can eat in a way that works for our planet as well as our bodies, the natural balance will be restored.”\n",

      "Text: Business leaders in the north of England have written to the prime minister, chancellor and energy secretary asking for help to reach net zero. Big names including Drax, Siemens, Peel, Manchester airport, the CBI and all 11 local enterprise partnerships (LEPs) in the north signed a letter urging the government to prioritise green growth in the north. The letter called for a meeting to discuss investment that would close “regional disparities by creating hundreds of thousands of highly skilled new jobs and building healthy, resilient communities”. The north already generated 50% of England’s renewable energy and was decarbonising 13% faster than the country as a whole, the group said. The business leaders signing the open letter were ambitious to go even further, they added, arguing that the north of England could help the UK take advantage of the huge economic opportunity the global transition to net zero represents. A report last year by the 11 LEPs in partnership with Nature North, Transport for the North and the N8 research group found that green investment in the north could unlock £6bn of prosperity. It identified areas that could be further developed, such as offshore wind capabilities in the North Sea and the Mersey Tidal Power project, as well as nature projects such as the Great Northern Forest, which will ultimately plant at least 50m trees across the north of England, and the Great North Bog, an ambitious peatland restoration initiative that will restore nearly 7,000 sq km of upland peat. The business leaders welcomed a £20bn commitment to carbon capture, utilisation and storage outlined in the budget and in the Powering Up Britain policy paper released last week. The paper, setting out how the government would enhance the UK’s energy security and deliver on its net zero commitments, was published by the new Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, which was established in February and is headed up by Grant Shapps. The letter read: “Our region has an industrial heritage like nowhere else in the world. A driving force of the original Industrial Revolution, the north continues to produce innovations that are central to UK competitiveness and are changing the world. Nowhere is this clearer than in green and low-carbon technologies. “Half of all renewable energy generated in England comes from the north. There are exciting plans to use carbon capture and hydrogen to decarbonise our major industrial regions. Although we have traditionally been a large carbon emitter, thanks to these new low carbon opportunities, the region is now decarbonising significantly faster than the UK as a whole.” It added: “Just as the north led national growth in the first Industrial Revolution, and transformed the future of the country, we can and will lead the transition towards low-carbon energy, generating a surplus of secure clean energy and reaping economic rewards. “We have the skills, the desire, and the drive to take this once-in-a-generation opportunity. We are ambitious to capitalise on the huge international demand for the technologies northern business are developing.”\n",

      "Text: The world’s renewable energy industry grew at its fastest pace since 1999 last year, despite the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, and may have established a standard for growth in the future, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The global energy watchdog revealed that the delivery of renewable energy projects, including windfarms and solar power projects, grew by 45% last year in a step change for the global industry. Wind power capacity doubled over the last year, while solar power grew by almost 50% more than its growth before the pandemic, due to the growing appetite for clean energy from governments and corporations. The clean energy boom has prompted the IEA to revise its renewable energy forecasts for the coming years up by about 25% from its previous growth estimates due to the faster than expected expansion of renewables in China, Europe and the US. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said governments need to “build on this promising momentum” by putting in place policies that “encourage greater investment in solar and wind, in the additional grid infrastructure they will require, and in other key renewable technologies such as hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal”. “A massive expansion of clean electricity is essential to giving the world a chance of achieving its net zero goals,” Birol added. China remains at the heart of the renewable energy industry’s growth after accounting for more than 40% of the global growth in the market for the last few years. It is also one of the largest suppliers of the raw materials needed to make wind turbines and solar panels including silicon, glass, steel, copper and other rare earth materials. However, China is also the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases because of its use of coal-fired power plants to meet the country’s rising energy demand. The country’s president, Xi Jinping, has pledged that China will become carbon neutral by 2060, but experts have warned that it will need to develop enough renewable energy to shut down nearly 600 of its coal-fired power plants in the next 10 years to meet this target. The passing of a key industry deadline for state subsidies in China is expected to cause the country’s renewable energy growth to slow in the years ahead. But the IEA believes booming demand for clean energy across Europe and the US will keep the global industry’s annual growth close to last year’s level. Heymi Bahar, the IEA’s lead author of the report, described last year’s renewables boom as “unprecedented” because although it matched the rate last seen in 1999 the industry has become far larger in the last two decades. He said record levels of government auctions for new renewable energy projects combined with a rising number of companies seeking to switch to renewables powered the “exceptional increase”, which is set to become “the new normal for renewable energy”. “The momentum is there from business and government,” he added. The IEA’s latest forecasts do not take into account the new US president, Joe Biden, whose administration is expected to spur an even faster rate of renewables growth. Biden has pledged to cut US emissions by half in the next 10 years. In the UK, the growth of the offshore wind industry is forecast to account for a quarter of the world’s offshore wind capacity by 2022, making it the only country in the world to have more wind power generated off its coast than on its land.  This article was amended on 12 May 2021 to clarify in the subheading that the 45% figure refers to the rise in the rate of new capacity, rather than a rise in new capacity.\n",

      "Text: Eating a vegan diet massively reduces the damage to the environment caused by food production, the most comprehensive analysis to date has concluded. The research showed that vegan diets resulted in 75% less climate-heating emissions, water pollution and land use than diets in which more than 100g of meat a day was eaten. Vegan diets also cut the destruction of wildlife by 66% and water use by 54%, the study found. The heavy impact of meat and dairy on the planet is well known, and people in rich nations will have to slash their meat consumption in order to end the climate crisis. But previous studies have used model diets and average values for the impact of each food type. In contrast, the new study analysed the real diets of 55,000 people in the UK. It also used data from 38,000 farms in 119 countries to account for differences in the impact of particular foods that are produced in different ways and places. This significantly strengthens confidence in the conclusions. However, it turned out that what was eaten was far more important in terms of environmental impacts than where and how it was produced. Previous research has shown that even the lowest-impact meat – organic pork – is responsible for eight times more climate damage than the highest-impact plant, oilseed. The researchers said the UK should introduce policies to help people reduce the amount of meat they eat in order to meet the nation’s climate targets. Ministers have repeatedly said they will not tell people what to consume, despite the precedent of, for example, taxes on high-sugar drinks. Prof Peter Scarborough at Oxford University, who led the research, published in the journal Nature Food, said: “Our dietary choices have a big impact on the planet. Cutting down the amount of meat and dairy in your diet can make a big difference to your dietary footprint.” The global food system has a huge impact on the planet, emitting a third of the total greenhouse gas emissions driving global heating. It also uses 70% of the world’s freshwater and causes 80% of river and lake pollution. About 75% of the Earth’s land is used by humans, largely for farming, and the destruction of forests is the major cause of the huge losses in biodiversity. Prof Neil Ward at the University of East Anglia said: “This is a significant set of findings. It scientifically reinforces the point made by the Climate Change Committee and the National Food Strategy over recent years that dietary shifts away from animal-based foods can make a major contribution to reducing the UK’s environmental footprint.” The study also showed that low-meat diets – less than 50g a day – had half the impact of high-meat diets on greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution and land use. However, the differences between low-meat, pescetarian and vegetarian diets were relatively small. Prof Richard Tiffin at the University of Reading said: “This study represents the most comprehensive attempt to link food consumption data to the data on the environmental impacts of food production. “Encouraging high-meat-eaters to reduce meat consumption and encouraging vegetarians to become vegans should result in lower emissions,” he said. “However, it’s hard to justify changes to the diets of moderate omnivores on the basis of these results, other than to switch to a completely vegan diet.” The researchers who conducted the new study said diets enabling global food production to be sustainable would mean people in rich nations “radically” reducing meat and dairy consumption. They said other ways of reducing the environmental impact of the food system, such as new technology and cutting food waste, would not be enough. The biggest difference seen in the study was for emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas produced by cattle and sheep, which were 93% lower for vegan diets compared with high-meat diets. The UK Health Alliance on Climate Change recommended in 2020 that sustainable diets should be supported by mandatory environmental labelling on foods, regulation of promotions and taxation of high-carbon foods. A government spokesperson said: “People should make their own decisions around the food they eat. Achieving the net-zero target is a priority, and whilst food choices can have an impact on greenhouse gas emissions, well-managed livestock also provide environmental benefits such as supporting biodiversity, protecting the character of the countryside, and generating important income for rural communities.” The farming minister, Mark Spencer, said last week that he would like to see genetically modified cows that emit less methane.\n",

      "Text: Campaigners have condemned the mayor of London’s new environment strategy for falling short by failing to announce the establishment of a publicly owned energy company for Londoners, one of his manifesto promises. Sadiq Khan published his environment policy on Friday, which aims to turn the capital into a zero waste and zero emissions city by 2050 and ensure that more than half of the city is covered in parks and green spaces in the same time frame. But the Green party and other campaigners have accused Khan of failing to carry out his pledge to create a not-for-profit energy company for the city, instead putting it out to tender. Caroline Russell, a Green party member of the London Assembly, said the failure to include the aim in his environmental strategy was a blow for Londoners. “Despite the mayor telling me it was ‘the idea’ for Energy for Londoners to be fully licensed, this doesn’t seem to be the case,” she said. “A publicly-owned Energy for Londoners was a brilliant opportunity to make a real difference to Londoners, providing residents, schools, hospitals and businesses with affordable, low-carbon energy. “It would also provide a massive opportunity to reinvest profits from the sales revenues in generating more renewable energy and addressing fuel poverty with energy efficiency measures. “The mayor told me he would release details of his feasibility report that led to this choice and I will be holding him to his promise so this decision can be properly scrutinised.” Khan’s environmental strategy promises to turn London into a global leader on the environment. He outlines how he aims to cut air pollution, reduce waste, end reliance on fossil fuels and create a greener, cleaner city by 2050. Many of the measures in the plan – which is out to public consultation for three months – have already been announced, including the phasing out of diesel vehicles via measures including the creation of an ultra-low emission charging zone in central London by 2019, which will be extended to outer London by 2021. Khan promises to plant more trees, reduce plastic packaging waste, improve recycling and bring London’s air quality into legal limits. But his manifesto promise on creating a publicly owned energy company for Londoners is not part of the plan. Instead the strategy says he will tender for the delivery of an energy supply company, aiming to offer fairer energy bills to Londoners and encourage Londoners to switch and move away from pre-payment meters. This, campaigners say, is a far cry from the publicly owned energy company which was promised. Laura Hill of campaign group Switched On London criticised the strategy as a whitewash. “For all the bold words, Sadiq is dithering on the single boldest step he could take in the fight against fuel poverty, missing his best opportunity to cut bills for hard-up London households,” she said. “London doesn’t need yet another branding exercise, we need our own public company, controlled democratically by and for Londoners. Sadiq says London can lead on climate; this announcement shows there is no intent to be a clean energy leader – or even a peer – with other European cities.” Last year Khan told the assembly he was pursuing the idea of a publicly owned company but indicated the work was lengthy. “I committed to a not-for-profit energy company in my manifesto and my officers are taking this forward as part of the early work of Energy for Londoners. It is potentially a significant undertaking and so rigorous feasibility and business modelling will be carried out to determine the most appropriate structure and functions of the company in order to achieve the overarching objectives of reducing carbon dioxide emissions and alleviating fuel poverty in London.” The aim was to model the company on similar firms set up in Bristol and Nottingham, where the city council set up the not-for-profit company Robin Hood energy. A spokesperson for the mayor said: “The mayor believes fuel poverty is a serious issue that needs addressing immediately, which is why he is keen to introduce a scheme using an energy supply company that can offer Londoners struggling with fuel poverty a better deal on their energy bills as soon as possible. “The mayor has allocated over £25m to deliver this programme alongside energy efficiency, fuel poverty and clean energy schemes. The option to move to a fully licensed supply company will be kept under review in light of changes in the energy market. The mayor welcomes all views on his plans during the strategy consultation. Nothing is off the table.”\n",

All the parking bays were suspended and minicabs no longer idled their engines during the night. I found myself living in an accidental Low Emissions Zone. It was wonderful. Yet despite research telling us that even very low levels of air pollution can shorten our lives, there are plans for just six Clean Air Zones across the UK by 2019. Instead, our dreams of breathable air lie with the Electric Vehicle (EV) revolution. It’s coming to save us in, um, 23 years (new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in 2040). Can EVs really save the day? When it comes to decarbonising, yes. Growth in electric vehicles alone could save 2m barrels of oil per day by 2025. Impressive. But there are concerns over limitations of battery technology and the rare earth minerals needed to produce them. Those who tried to save the planet last time around by buying a diesel car and have been left with a particulate-spewing monster are obviously feeling tender. At the extreme end of EV bashing is Dirty Secrets of Electric Cars, a video from a pro-fossil fuel advocacy group connected to the global-warming-denying Koch brothers. The best I can say is that it lacks imagination. And you need imagination when buying into the promise of electric power. This is not just swapping cars, it’s about a whole new decarbonised power structure, one that takes periodic giant leaps forwards, in battery technology, in grid and storage innovation. The pavement on my street is sadly completed – but I had a brief taste of low pollution, and I can tell you it’s exhilarating.

The Greens’ leader, Adam Bandt, said he could be open to other ways of dealing with coal and gas other than the outright ban it has proposed, including a suggestion by the Climate Council that the government halt approvals until reform of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act is worked through later this year. The minor party is pushing for the EPBC Act to include a climate trigger, which would for the first time require the environment minister to consider the climate impact of a major development during the approval process. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, has not supported a climate trigger but Labor has backed one in the past. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, introduced an unsuccessful climate trigger bill while opposition environment spokesperson in 2005. Speaking on Guardian Australia’s Australian Politics podcast, Bandt raised the Climate Council proposal and said the Greens were happy to also look at other suggestions as long as they dealt with “the desire to keep opening up coal and gas mines and also the fact that pollution from coal and gas grows under the government scheme, potentially”. “We would look at all those suggestions that are put on the table and we would consider them in good faith,” he said. “From our perspective, what we’re saying is we’ve got to deal with this question of opening up new coal and gas mines because that’s not only untenable, and is going to put a safer climate out of reach, but it’s even going to make meeting … the government’s own targets more difficult.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Greens have introduced a bill for a climate trigger that would block developments that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of CO2 a year. Other models have been proposed that would require the environment minister to consider the climate impact of a proposal, but give them greater discretion over how it was dealt with. Plibersek has said that companies will need to include emissions forecasts in development applications under her changes, but has not endorsed a trigger. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, and Bandt have committed to negotiating over the safeguard mechanism, which as proposed would put a new emissions intensity limit on 215 big polluting industrial sites and require most companies to make a 4.9% cut each year. The government is also negotiating with the independent senator David Pocock. Critics of the scheme from a climate perspective have objected to the government allowing companies to open new fossil fuel projects and buy an unlimited number of carbon credits, created through contentious forest regeneration and other projects, to meet emissions limits. Industrial companies and lobby groups have supported the scheme in principal, but some have argued for special treatment. The government was criticised at a senate inquiry this week for refusing to release its analysis forecasting how the scheme would operate, including the extent to which polluters would make onsite cuts and rely on offsets. Bowen said the analysis was “cabinet-in-confidence”. Asked about other potential points of agreement with the government – including introducing a total cap on emissions from the scheme, imposing more onerous requirements on new entrants and waiting for a promised overhaul of the the carbon credit scheme to be fully implemented – Bandt said he “didn’t want to run those negotiations in public”. “If we end up with a scheme where pollution from coal and gas goes down rather than up – as is the trajectory at the moment – then that broadly is where we want to get to because … what’s driving the problem is coal and gas. And so those ideas about having a cap, or what you do about new projects that come into the scheme, are obviously ways of addressing what might happen to coal and gas,” he said. “The starting point is a question about whether the government agrees it wants pollution from coal and gas [to] go up or down.” More than 100 scientists and policy experts, including Nobel laureate Prof Peter Doherty, former Australian of the year Prof Fiona Stanley and Climate Change Authority member Prof Lesley Hughes, this week signed an open letter calling on the government to not allow new fossil fuel projects as the world was “on the precipice of irreversible, catastrophic climate change”. The government is proposing to change the safeguard through both legislation and regulation. The former will turn it into an emissions trading scheme, as also proposed by the previous Coalition government. It wants the revamped scheme, which it says is central to meeting the national 2030 emissions target of a 43% cut compared with 2005 levels, to start on 1 July. The senate inquiry into the safeguard is due to report back on Monday.\n",

Humans have been living in close contact with fire ever since it first enabled us to cook food, keep warm and develop our brain capacity. Thousands of people in rural Britain (including me), and billions throughout the world, rely on wood fires as their primary means of cooking or heating, with minimal greenhouse gas emissions compared with gas cookers and oil-fired central heating, not to mention HGVs. “The green transition is actually about stopping burning things,” says Kåre Press-Kristensen, the lead author of the study. Really? Once he and his colleagues have succeeded in banning domestic wood stoves, they will presumably turn their attention to candles, campfires, bonfires and agricultural burning. When these are outlawed, they will need to deal with wildfires, which will increase if brushwood is not gathered up for fuel. Finally, when they have plugged the last volcano, and flame on earth is extinguished, their green transition will be consummate and humans will have added a few weeks to their life expectancy. As for the comparison with HGVs, perhaps these scientists would like to prove their point by directing the fumes from the exhaust of a diesel lorry into their living room?Simon FairlieCharmouth, Dorset  I commend your crusading zeal against pollution from wood-burning stoves, but it may not be as simple as you imply. I write as an owner of a Defra-approved “clean” log-burning stove. We are rural and burn only our own wood (naturally fallen or felled for safety). This is stored until the moisture content falls below 18% and burnt in the evening after the neighbours have closed their windows against the cold. We’re even willing to consider an electrostatic particulate filter. We’ve reduced our energy bill and had thought we might have been helping the environment. Burnt wood emits marginally more CO2 than Robert Frost’s “slow smokeless burning of decay”, but no methane – a much more potent greenhouse gas.

      "Text: I must commend the Guardian and Damian Carrington for the excellent reporting on the views of leading climate scientists (‘Hopeless and broken’ Why the world’s top climate scientists are in despair, 8 May). I have experienced climate despair, which has led me to take part in non-violent protests, and I can certainly bear witness to the fact that this kind of collective action goes a long way to offset the despair. However, protest is not for everyone. There are other ways to play our part. We can help to accelerate the energy transition. Some 51% of final energy consumption is for heating and cooling, and 32% is for transport, according to the International Energy Agency, so we must ditch the old boiler and invest in a heat pump, and swap our petrol car for an electric model. By fitting solar panels, we can also generate renewable energy to power both transport and heating. Having done these things myself, I have found that the lightening of my carbon footprint brings with it a lightening of climate despair. If we support the drive to achieve net zero, we should also join the dots and realise that this means we each have to live net zero lives. Collective acceptance of this may be one of the “social tipping points” that would accelerate the solution. We need to make it socially unacceptable to drive combustion cars and heat our homes with fossil fuels. The Guardian is one of a few major newspapers worldwide that is prepared to give the climate crisis the prominence it deserves. Maybe it can be one of the first to help bring about this social tipping point.John CoghlanBradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire  Your article (World’s top climate scientists expect global heating to blast past 1.5C target, 8 May) and editorial in the same edition (The Guardian view on the climate emergency: we cannot afford to despair, 8 May) highlight the strong emotions felt by the climate science community about where we are in terms of tackling climate change. The words – hopeless, infuriated, scared – stand in contrast to the usual dispassionate language of climate science. Your editorial cautions against despair because it is counterproductive. And yet conversations about climate action continue to be coloured by depictions of a dystopian future. Over the past few months, Climate Outreach and More in Common talked to more than 5,000 people across Britain. We’re hearing something a bit different from ordinary people: that government action and investment in tackling climate change makes many people feel positive. The majority want to press ahead with net zero, believing it will be good for the UK. They have hope. Climate action happens when people feel a sense of agency – when we believe that we can do something, and that what we do matters. This is the conclusion of a vast amount of social science research – and our own work at Climate Outreach. If we’re to avoid the version of the future that experts fear, we urgently need a new climate conversation.Rachael OrrCEO, Climate Outreach  Your editorial is absolutely right that social and political tipping points on climate action are on the horizon, which is why scientists – while their warnings must be urgently heeded, together with the information that every 0.1 degree is important – are not best placed to prophesy our climate fate. A business-as-usual society with added technology will not do. Solar panels, electric buses and a circular economy are essential for a livable planet, but without social innovation they will only deliver us to a cleaner disaster. Ending financialisation of public services and the crisis of “too much finance”, cutting working hours (with a four-day week without loss of pay for starters) and introducing a universal basic income – to free up human time, energy and talents to be directed well – are the kind of foundational changes that can and must be part of climate action. Scientists are not the experts here. Grassroots political activists, campaigners, independent thinkers, indigenous traditions and the people collectively, through participatory democracy, can see and deliver the path to human societies living within the physical limits of this fragile planet while caring for climate and nature. Natalie BennettGreen party, House of Lords; author of Change Everything: How We Can Rethink, Repair and Rebuild Society  It doesn’t require a survey to know that the global mean temperature rise will breach 1.5C before 2030. In 2023, Jim Hansen demonstrated that the rate of warming, 0.18C per decade since the early 70s, has increased to 0.27C per decade since 2010. The reasons for the acceleration in warming are not entirely clear, but two important possibilities are the rapid rise in atmospheric methane since 2008, and the loss of aerosol cooling from legislation limiting the sulphur content of fuels used for shipping. The IPCC are therefore deluded if they are claiming that the 1.5C limit is still achievable.Dr Robin Russell-Jones Founder, Help Rescue the Planet  Thank you for your explainer article “What are the most powerful climate actions you can take?” (What are the most powerful climate actions you can take? The expert view, the guardian.com, 9 May). The experts you interviewed are quite right in saying that the most powerful action is to vote, but one is quite wrong in saying that “individual action can only amount to a drop in the bucket”. Telling people that they’re just a drop in a bucket is not going to motivate them to act. In New York state back in the 70s, Consolidated Edison asked consumers to save electricity because of the fuel crisis. In response, it was said that individual consumers saved so much electricity that the utility applied for a rate hike. No one set out to destroy the environment. Survival once meant grabbing everything we could get and doing everything the cheap and easy way. Now we can and must act differently. Voting is fine, but all of us drops in this bucket must also change our consumption habits. Billions of individual decisions put us in this hole; billions of individual decisions will get us out.Gregory JohnsonBergesserin, Bourgogne, France  Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

      "Text: “A liveable and sustainable future for all”. It is the very last words of the new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that spell out what is at stake. In short, it is everything. The damage from global heating is already hitting hard. The comprehensive IPCC assessment, which is based on 34,000 studies, documents “widespread and pervasive” impacts on people and the natural world from increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, storms and floods. Some impacts are now irreversible. Heat is killing more people, drought is killing more trees and warming oceans are killing more coral reefs, the nurseries of the oceans. But without action, worse is coming, the report said, and faster than scientists had thought. The new report analyses the impacts of the climate crisis and how humanity can adapt, in addition to slashing emissions. The good news is that a liveable future remains within grasp – just. But the window of opportunity for action is “brief and rapidly closing”. The response from UN secretary-general António Guterres was stark: “Delay is death.” But tackling climate impacts alone will not work. The IPCC sets out in the strongest terms to date that the climate crisis is inseparable from the biodiversity crisis and the poverty and inequality suffered by billions of people. Given this scope, and with a liveable future on the line, the assessment could be seen as one of the most important in human history. It was produced by more than 1,000 physical and social scientists and unanimously approved by the governments of 195 nations. “I have seen many scientific reports in my time, but nothing like this,” said Guterres. Laurence Tubiana, at the European Climate Foundation and one of the architects of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, said the report was “brutal” and “there can be no more excuses” for inaction. Already, 3.5 billion people are highly vulnerable to climate impacts and half the world’s population suffers severe water shortages at some point each year, the report said. One in three people are exposed to deadly heat stress, and this is projected to increase to 50% to 75% by the end of the century. Half a million more people are at risk of serious flooding every year, and a billion living on coasts will be exposed by 2050, the report said. Rising temperatures and rainfall are increasing the spread of diseases in people, such as dengue fever, and in crops, livestock and wildlife. Even if the world keeps heating below 1.6C by 2100 – and we are already at 1.1C – then 8% of today’s farmland will become climatically unsuitable, just after the global population has peaked above 9 billion. Severe stunting could affect 1 million children in Africa alone. If global heating continues and little adaptation is put in place, 183 million more people are projected to go hungry by 2050. The ability to produce food relies on the water, soils and pollination provided by a healthy natural world, and the report said protection of wild places and wildlife is fundamental to coping with the climate crisis. But animals and plants are being exposed to climatic conditions not experienced for tens of thousands of years. Half of the studied species have already been forced to move and many face extinction. Maintaining the resilience of nature at a global scale depends on the conservation of 30% to 50% of Earth’s land, freshwater and oceans, the IPCC report said. Today, less than 15% of land, 21% of freshwater and 8% of oceans are protected areas, and some regions, like the Amazon, have switched from storing carbon to emitting it. The IPCC report is also crystal clear that adapting to the climate crisis is as much a social problem as a scientific one. The best way to give effective and lasting protection from climate chaos is through action that addresses “inequities such as those based on gender, ethnicity, disability, age, location and income”. “Targeting a climate resilient, sustainable world involves fundamental changes to how society functions, including changes to underlying values, world-views, ideologies, social structures, political and economic systems, and power relationships,” the report’s authors said in an accompanying document. “This may feel overwhelming at first, but the world is changing anyway – climate-resilient development offers us ways to drive change to improve wellbeing for all.” The report warned that climate “losses and damages” are “strongly concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations”, who have done least to cause the problem. That is a significant phrase, echoing the “loss and damage” for which low-income nations are demanding compensation from rich nations, and which will be a key issue at the next UN climate summit in Egypt in November. Madeleine Diouf Sarr, the chair of the Least Developed Countries at the UN climate talks, said: “I read this report with a great deal of fear and sadness, but not surprise. It’s very clear to us that no amount of adaptation can compensate for failing to limit warming to 1.5C.” However, the regional analysis in the IPCC report demonstrates that the climate crisis affects everyone. In North America, it warns of increasing deaths and physical and mental illness due to greater extreme weather, from storms to wildfires. In Europe, “substantive agricultural production losses are projected for most areas over the 21st century”. Australia faces “increases in heat-related mortality and morbidity for people and wildlife”, while “destruction” lies in wait for small island settlements. In central and south America, “severe health effects due to increasing epidemics” are anticipated, particularly from diseases spread by insects and other animals. Among the most populous continents, one of Asia’s greatest risks is flooding, and Africa is haunted by hunger as climate impacts hit farmers. The IPCC message that hope remains is measured: “Near-term actions that limit global warming to close to 1.5°C would substantially reduce projected losses and damages related to climate change in human systems and ecosystems, but cannot eliminate them all.” Some low-lying areas appear doomed already. The report also noted that “losses and damages escalate with every increment of global warming”, meaning every action to cut emissions or adapt matters. Adaptation is heavily underfunded, the IPCC said, but investment now is far cheaper than acting later. Among the adaptation measures the IPCC cites are restoring wetlands to protect against flooding, greening the world’s fast-growing cities to cool them, and using trees to shade crops and livestock. The IPCC scientists said the end of the century is less than a lifetime away, with a child born today being 78 years old in 2100: “Actions taken now will have a profound effect on the quality of our children’s lives.” The future is in the decisions we make today, said Christiana Figueres, former UN climate chief and now at the Global Optimism group: “We can prevent and protect ourselves from extreme weather, famines, health problems and more by cutting emissions and investing in adaptation strategies. The science and the solutions are clear. It’s up to us how we shape the future.”\n",

      "Text: A list of the 20 costliest climate disasters of 2023 has revealed a “global postcode lottery stacked against the poor”, according to an analysis. The research by the charity Christian Aid found that devastating wildfires and floods are hitting those who can least afford to rebuild, and the countries that have contributed least to the climate crisis by burning far fewer fossil fuels than wealthy nations, which have faced fewer climate disasters. The cost ranges from more than $4,000 (£3,155) per person due to a wildfire in Hawaiito $9 (£7) per person due to flooding in Peru. The research examined 20 natural disasters exacerbated by climate breakdown that hit 14 countries over the past year. The highest per capita cost was the wildfires in Hawaii in August, which far outstrips the second costliest, which was Guam’s storms in May, at a cost of nearly $1,500 (£1,182) per person. The analysis published on Wednesday highlights that countries with worse infrastructure and flimsier homes face larger costs after a climate disaster as their inhabited areas are more easily destroyed. In the areas where people have faced the highest costs, many are employed in agriculture, which is vulnerable to extreme weather, and the government is less likely to invest in prevention or rebuilding. Patrick Watt, the chief executive of Christian Aid, said: “When it comes to the climate crisis, there is a global postcode lottery that is stacked against the poor. In poorer countries, people are often less prepared for climate-related disasters and have fewer resources with which to bounce back. The upshot is that more people die, and recovery is slower and more unequal. There is a double injustice in the fact that the communities worst affected by global warming have contributed little to the problem. “Governments urgently need to take further action at home and internationally, to cut emissions, and adapt to the effects of climate change. And where the impacts go beyond what people can adapt to, the loss and damage fund must be resourced to compensate the poorest countries for the effects of a crisis that isn’t of their making.” Loss and damage, which refers to payments from wealthier, more polluting countries to those who emit fewer fossil fuels but bear the brunt of climate breakdown, has become part of climate negotiations in recent years. Developing countries have demanded climate justice after facing disasters that have been extremely costly to fix. At the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai this year, wealthy countries most responsible for the climate emergency promised a combined total of just over $700m (£556m) to the loss and damage fund – the equivalent of less than 0.2% of the irreversible economic and non-economic losses developing countries are facing from global heating every year. 1 Hawaii, US, wildfire – $4,1612 Guam, storm – $1,4553 Vanuatu, storm – $9474 New Zealand, storm – $4685 New Zealand, flood – $3716 Italy, flood – $1647 Libya, flood – $1058 Peru, flood – $669 Spain, drought – $5010 Myanmar, storm – $4111 Chile, flood – $3912 Haiti, flood – $3613 Mexico, storm – $3514 Chile, wildfire – $3015 US, storm – $2516 China, flood – $2317 Peru, storm – $2018 Malawi, storm – $1719 US, storm – $1620 Peru, flood – $9\n",

      "Text: British battery pioneers plan to build Europe’s largest energy storage project using a cryogenic battery that can store renewable energy for weeks rather than hours. The device will be built on the site of an old fossil fuel plant in the north of England to power up to 50,000 homes for up to five hours. Unlike traditional lithium-ion batteries, which typically store electricity for a few hours, the “cryobattery” will be able to store energy for months. The UK’s first full-scale cryobattery, developed by Highview Power, uses renewable electricity to chill air to -196C, transforming it into a liquid that will be stored in large metal tanks. When renewable electricity levels are low the liquid can be turned back into gas, which is used to turn a turbine and generate electricity – but without burning the gas and releasing emissions. Highview Power claims its cryobattery will be the largest project in Europe capable of long-term energy storage. The full-scale “liquid air” battery has a capacity of 50MW or 250MWh over a five-hour release time. It follows the success of a 5MW pathfinder project built next to a landfill site in Bury, Greater Manchester, in summer 2018 with £8m of funding from Innovate UK. The chief executive of Highview Power said the battery could provide cost-efficient energy storage at old fossil fuel plants across the country to help balance the energy system. “More and more power plants are going to be decommissioned, and we are bringing a solution which can use the same energy infrastructure and grid connections to give a new life to these sites,” Javier Cavada said. He added that long-duration, giga-scale energy storage was the “necessary foundation” to help build a carbon-free energy system that relies heavily on wind and solar power. The global shift towards clean electricity has spurred a boom in battery technology development to help harness wind and solar energy, and a flurry of investment plans from energy utilities. Highview said the cryobattery would cost about £110 per MWh of electricity, using a 200MW system, which would make it one of the cheapest energy storage technologies. The claim comes after an Edinburgh-based start-up, Gravitricity, said Britain’s cheapest virtual battery could be created by hoisting and dropping 12,000-tonne weights down disused mine shafts. A study by Imperial College London said the gravity energy could cost $171 (£132) per MWh, compared with an average lithium-ion project of $367 (£283) per MWh. Cavada said the company planned to finalise agreements with its project partner and would secure deals with National Grid to help provide grid balancing services. He declined to comment on the name of the disused power plant Highview planned to use.\n",

      "Text: The Forestry Commission was established 100 years ago to create a “strategic reserve of timber” after Lloyd George stated “Britain had more nearly lost the war for want of timber than of anything else”. The UK is 50% self-sufficient in food, but only 20% self-sufficient in wood, so we still want timber more than anything else. Any call to redirect subsidies to restore woodlands is welcome (Use farm subsidies to rewild quarter of UK, urges report, 21 May). The Rewilding Britain report states: “Commercial conifer plantations should not be eligible, except where they are removed and replaced with native woodland.” This approach is understandable if the aim is to increase habitat for wildlife. However, plantations are an excellent way to combat climate breakdown, because the growing trees sequester carbon and the forests store it, just like in more natural woodlands, but harvested wood products also provide a carbon substitution effect when used instead of concrete or steel. The report suggests healthier eating can release land from intensive agriculture, but conversely we should be using more, not less, wood. Any different approach in the way land is managed should include plantations, which can also be native trees to produce timber alongside the restoration and expansion of our most precious ancient semi-natural woodlands. Without this we are dependent on greenhouse gas emissions to import wood.Dr Andrew WeatherallNational School of Forestry  I’m a supporter of subsidies to encourage landowners to restore woodlands and meadows, but it’s of concern that Rewilding Britain seems to suggest that it’s OK to plant our heather moorland, as if it’s just sitting there doing nothing. You report that Rebecca Wrigley, its chief executive, said rewilding “did not have to involve an overall reduction in food production” and pointed to “millions of hectares of low-grade agricultural land, much of it in the uplands”. In fact, heather moorland is rarer than rainforest, and the underlying peat is more effective at carbon storage than trees. The UK contains 75% of the world’s remaining heather moorland – with grouse moor estates arguably containing the richest biodiversity – and we need to protect it. I also take issue with the term “rewilding”, which promulgates the romantic fallacy that all this is somehow going to look after itself. What is really meant is that landowners will be encouraged to manage the land in a different way. It’s important that the UK’s largely city-based population understands this.Rachel KerrBradford, West Yorkshire   Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com  Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters  Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

      "Text: Meat and farmed animals are wrongly blamed for the climate crisis without considering their benefits for society, argues a new campaign launched by the livestock industry in Europe. Billboards appeared this week in Brussels metro stations together with a social media campaign #meatthefacts. The adverts are being funded by European Livestock Voice, which is backed by organisations representing EU farmers, foie gras producers and the fur and leather industry. “We believe this campaign is necessary in order to address misinformation,” said a spokesperson for Livestock Voice. The group said they want people “to think about the whole picture and all the consequences that simplistic speeches calling … for a ‘drastic reduction of livestock’ could have on Europe’s rural areas and on society in general.” The campaign group says the current debate around meat and livestock has been one-sided, and that livestock’s contribution to biodiversity, bioenergy and the rural economy has been overlooked. “An EU without livestock would not only lose locally produced food, but also essential habitats and biodiversity. It would also mean increased fires, lack of natural fertiliser and green energy, and a rural exodus,” it says. Europeans eat more than twice as much meat as experts recommend. A report last year called for a 40–50% reduction in the size of Europe’s meat and livestock sector to reduce its environmental footprint. Research published in Nature journal concluded that beef consumption in western countries needs to fall by 90% in order to avoid dangerous climate change. The livestock sector is believed to be responsible for a minimum of 14.5% of global carbon emissions. But the new campaign group said that the livestock sector accounts for less than 6% of the EU’s total climate emissions.   Replacing animal products with plant-based alternatives is not the universal solution to climate change, it  maintains, as alternative foodstuffs have environmental footprints of their own. Replacing fossil fuels with green alternatives was a more effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the group said. Michael Lee, professor in sustainable agriculture at Rothamsted Research in Hertfordshire, one of the oldest agricultural research institutions in the world, said current eating habits were not sustainable, but livestock still had an important role to play. “Complete removal of livestock would be a disaster for agriculture sustainability, the long-term environment (due to loss of grassland), rural communities and human health – as not every vegan can be a selective nutritionist. Equally our current consumption levels are a disaster – with growing obesity and environmental damage due to high levels of emissions.  “The solution lies in a more plant-dominated diet but with a modest amount of high-quality livestock product – which is valued for the key nutrients it contains, its soil-improving properties and the landscape we all want to support and live in,” he said. A spokesperson for the European Livestock Voice said:  “It is well known that a section of the European population over consume animal products, but there is no evidence to suggest that reducing production will lead to any decrease in consumption. The consequences of a drastic reduction on consumption of animal products by replacing them with ‘meat substitutes’ or other activities could well be worse than the benefits of meat consumption, without leading to a significant environmental or health improvement.”\n",

      "Text: It will take five years and the drilling of 20 to 40 fracking wells to judge whether the UK has a viable shale gas industry, the chairman of the only company yet to have used modern hydraulic fracturing techniques here has told the Guardian. Lord Browne of Madingley, former chief of BP and now chairman of Cuadrilla, said the work must be done, because exploiting shale gas was \"a national imperative\". He said the process would take so long because of the UK's strict planning laws. \"We have very tight regulation, particularly on planning permission,\" he said. Browne, who is also a government adviser on business, was speaking on the fringes of a debate on fracking held by the thinktank Policy Exchange. He said that the UK had the potential for a large amount of shale gas exploration, but that aspiring companies would need much more information on whether the gas reserves are economic to exploit, and that could only come from further exploration. \"We have an idea of the UK's potential for shale - what we now need to do is figure out how much we can produce economically and how fast, which means wells need to be drilled and need to be fracked – there is no other way to do it,\" said Browne, who is also a managing partner at Riverstone Holdings, the venture capital firm that backs Cudrilla. Tony Bosworth, energy campaigner at Friends of the Earsh, said: \"Despite all the government bluster about fracking, the industry still doesn't know if it's viable in Britain, and it will take years to find out. And with experts warning it won't cut fuel bills and will do little to tackle climate change, the coalition's shale gas enthusiasm is looking increasingly ill-judged.\" He said renewable energy offered a better way to cut emissions: \"The solution to our energy challenges is staring us in the face, and we don't need to wait until the end of the decade. It's time to abandon the UK's fossil fuel addiction and invest in energy efficiency and the nation's world class renewable power potential.\" Cuadrilla has already spent more than £100m on exploration, the company told the Guardian last year, but so far has only fracked at one site. Browne said it was vital to the UK's future to pursue fracking, the operation of which on a massive scale has sent gas prices plummeting in the US in recent years. \"It is in the national interest of the UK to do something that is good for the UK and fits into the bigger picture [of combating climate change globally]. The US has done this and I find it extraordinary that we should step to one side and let the US and others get on with it. It is a national imperative.\" He said that the UK and Europe's current energy mix, in which large amounts of coal are still being used to generate electricity alongside renewable energy, was like being on a diet but eating \"lots of salad and then finishing with several scoops of ice cream\". Coal use has increased markedly in the UK in the past few years, reaching about 40% of electricity generation despite its high greenhouse gas emissions. That is partly because coal is cheap at present, as the massive exploitation of gas in the US has meant that coal that would have been burned there is now exported abroad. But Browne was downbeat on the potential for carbon capture and storage, which some experts have advocated as a way of rendering coal and other fossil fuels low-carbon. He said: \"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a very interesting idea – I tried to do the first CCS [project in the UK, while leading BP] but there was a gap between what it would cost and what we could afford. There are very few places in the world where CCS could be made to work. I would not rule it out but I would not rule it in.\" Prof Dieter Helm, an energy economist at Oxford University, agreed: \"Don't get terribly excited about CCS any time soon – the volume of [carbon dioxide] gas is greater than the stuff that comes out of the ground. And there aren't enough holes [in which to store the CO2].\" Browne said it was possible to make fracking more environmentally friendly, through capturing any fugitive methane emissions and by using less water, and recycling the water used. \"Fracking is not fossilised technology, it is moving to use less water. This technology is not static.\" He said that there was no conflict between investment in renewable energy and in shale gas. Helm said that renewable energy subsidies would be \"permanent, not transitory\" for current technologies such as on- and offshore wind and solar panels. He advised much larger levels of research and development into new generations of renewable technologies, including geothermal energy and the possibilities of graphene. Jason Anderson, head of EU climate and energy policy at WWF, said the first priority should be energy efficiency. \"The main challenge for Europe is to renovate the 80% of buildings built before we had good energy efficiency standards,\" he said.\n",

      "Text: Cows on farms could soon have their health, reproductive readiness and location monitored by smart technology powered by the kinetic energy of the animal’s movements. Devices that monitor the health of each cow or keep them within invisible fences are already used on farms but these smart tools are often powered by chemical batteries, which add to energy used by an emissions-intensive industry. Alternatives such as solar-powered monitors – deployed in Britain to create fenceless grazing for cows – may depend on the weather. But researchers from China writing in the journal iScience have designed a wearable smart device for cows that captures the kinetic energy created by their smallest movements. “There is a tremendous amount of kinetic energy that can be harvested in cattle’s daily movements, such as walking, running, and even neck movement,” said Zutao Zhang, an energy researcher at Southwest Jiaotong University and co-author of the paper. His team’s design uses a motion-enhancement mechanism made up of magnets and a pendulum to amplify small movements made by cows. “Our kinetic energy harvester specially harvests the kinetic energy of weak motion,” said Zhang. The technology is housed in a scallop-shaped shell, which is attached to a cow’s ankle or neck. An electromagnetic generator converts kinetic into electrical energy. This is stored in a lithium battery which powers the wireless monitors. Information can then be gathered, including the amount of exercise the animal gets, reproductive cycles, disease, oxygen concentration, air temperature, humidity and milk production, helping ensure good health and improving breeding productivity. Researchers tested the devices on humans and found that a light jog was enough to power temperature measurement in the device. They see future applications in sports monitoring, healthcare and smart home systems. “Kinetic energy is everywhere in the environment – leaves swaying in the wind, the movement of people and animals, the undulation of waves, the rotation of the earth –these phenomena all contain a lot of kinetic energy,” said Zhang. “We shouldn’t let this energy go to waste.”\n",

      "Text: A new political party committed to solving the climate crisis plans to challenge the Tories in more than 100 seats at the next election, targeting climate-denying Tory backbenchers. Launched as a centre-right, single-issue party, the Climate party aims to provide Conservative voters with a business-friendly, climate-serious alternative to the Tories, whose leadership candidates have been reticent over the party’s net zero commitments as Britain buckled under 40C heat for the first time on record. “That’s not leadership,” said Ed Gemmell, the founder of the Climate party. “That’s self-interest.” Gemmell, a former army officer and city lawyer, registered the Climate party with the electoral commission on Britain’s hottest day last week. Unlike his Tory counterparts, he has spent years working on the climate crisis and believes climate-conscious Conservative voters do not feel respected and feel ignored by the party’s leadership. He hopes the Climate party will provide them with an alternative that will protect the economy, people and the climate. “We’ve got one election left to save the planet,” he said. The Climate party plans to challenge the Conservatives in 110 marginal seats in the next election where the Conservatives are only winning by up to 7,000 votes. Gemmell said his party would also target the 19 Tory MPs who are members of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, a collection of Conservative backbenchers who opposed the government’s net zero policies. “The Craig Mackinlays, the Steve Bakers – we’ll stand against them in every single place. Any Conservative that tries to join that group and destroy the future of my kids, and lose us this big opportunity, we will put a centre-right candidate against them.” The Tories may well be spooked. Gemmell beat Conservative rivals to become a councillor in Buckinghamshire in May 2019, elected as an independent candidate with a single policy, “climate action now”. He went on to become a councillor for Hazlemere last year, and is the managing director of Scientists Warning Europe, a charity that promotes “science-endorsed solutions” for the energy transition. The recent Australian general election may also provide a cautionary tale. In that poll, climate-focused candidates, named the “teal independents”, focused on seats held by the rightwing Liberal party. They won several seats and took votes away from the Liberals in many others, leading to a parliamentary majority for Anthony Albanese’s Labour party. The heart of the Climate party’s policy is decarbonising the economy by 2030. Gemmell’s vision is for the UK to become a global leader in the energy transition by stopping all subsidies for fossil fuel companies, implementing polluter-pays policies to stimulate the circular economy, and investing in renewable infrastructures and technologies. Rather than allowing the left a monopoly on such policies, Gemmell says these are smart, pro-business ideas that will give the UK economy a competitive advantage as the whole world increasingly turns its attention to decarbonising and the energy transition. He says the policies are not nearly as radical as the Tory government would have voters believe, claiming one-third of British councils are already committed to carbon zero by 2030. Gemmell said: “It’s not a big policy for government because it’s already happening”, adding that the climate pledges at the heart of Conservative policy were harmful and revealed the party’s unfocused approach to the threat of the climate crisis. He said rapid decarbonisation by 2030 was the only way to protect the planet from climate tipping points, a term coined by IPCC scientists 20 years ago to describe the point at which small changes become significant enough to cause a larger, more critical change that can be abrupt, irreversible, and lead to cascading effects. For now, the Climate party is still building the rest of its manifesto, but he said many Conservative voters were desperate for a party that reflected their deep concerns about climate breakdown, even if that party did not have all the answers. “The whole point is to bring the focus in of all of the great minds in Britain, the focus of the finance sector in driving that, to get to the point where we can answer those questions,” said Gemmell. “Until we start on that path with a war-like effort, we aren’t going to make it.”\n",

      "Text: Shell has argued that it “lobbies for, not against, the energy transition” on the final day of its appeal against an important climate ruling. The fossil fuel company is fighting the decision of a Dutch court in 2021 that forces it to pump 45% less planet-heating CO2 into the atmosphere by 2030 than it did in 2019. In court on Friday, Shell argued the ruling is ineffective, onerous and does not fit into the existing legal system. Lawyers for Milieudefensie (Friends of the Earth Netherlands), which brought the case against Shell, repeated their calls for the company to act in line with climate science and international agreements to stop extreme weather from growing more violent. They said the outcome of the case will determine how much the climate changes. “It’s not just about Shell,” said Donald Pols, the Milieudefensie chief executive, after the hearing. “We want to hold all companies accountable – to combat dangerous climate change.” Shell argued in court that it plays its role in energy transition and pointed to the lobbying it had done in favour of climate policies such as the EU emissions-trading scheme and the US Inflation Reduction Act. Milieudefensie said it was “quite clear” that Shell had used its social influence to safeguard the role of oil and gas and that it had continued to do so with its policies. In recent months, Shell has backtracked on a series of clean energy ambitions. “I think it’s a little bit far-fetched from Shell to argue they are in favour of the energy transition, at least to the extent of being in line with the Paris agreement,” said Roger Cox, Milieudefensie’s lawyer in the case. The appeal wraps up just days after the European court of human rights sided with a group of 2,400 Swiss women who sued their government over its climate policy. Both Shell and Milieudefensie cited the Swiss case to support their arguments on Friday. Shell argued that the decision of the 17 Strasbourg judges showed it was up to states, rather than companies, to rein in emissions. Milieudefensie said it showed that “judges have an important role to play in the complex debate on preventing dangerous climate change”. A report last week found that 57 companies are linked to 80% of carbon emissions since 2016, though the bulk of that comes from their customers burning the fuels they sell. At the appeal, Milieudefensie argued that Shell should not achieve the original emissions reduction target by simply selling off fossil fuel assets, which may then land in the hands of companies with less public scrutiny and dirtier operations. Shell argued that the original ruling gave it the freedom to do so and said the activist group had failed to contest this point by lodging a cross-appeal. Frans Everts, director of Shell in the Netherlands, said in the company’s closing remarks that he was concerned by the “unintended consequences” of the lawsuit. He said the activists wanted to limit the supply of Shell’s products before its customers are “able, willing or ready to switch to less fossil fuels”. He said: “As long as the demand for these products doesn’t change – and people can just go to the competitor – there is not one less carbon molecule in the air. And without a clean alternative to oil and gas products, the energy transition will not benefit either.” In 2021, after evidence for the original case was filed, the International Energy Agency published a report on reaching net zero emissions by 2050 that found no room for new oil and gas exploration. Companies including Shell have since continued to invest in new oil and gas fields despite protests from climate scientists and activists. A verdict is expected on 12 November 2024.\n",

      "Text: If the outlook for marine life was already looking bleak – torrents of plastic that can suffocate and starve fish, overfishing, diverse forms of human pollution that create dead zones, the effects of global warming which is bleaching coral reefs and threatening coldwater species – another threat is quietly adding to the toxic soup. Ocean acidification is progressing rapidly around the world, new research has found, and its combination with the other threats to marine life is proving deadly. Many organisms that could withstand a certain amount of acidification are at risk of losing this adaptive ability owing to pollution from plastics, and the extra stress from global warming. The conclusions come from an eight-year study into the effects of ocean acidification which found our increasingly acid seas – a byproduct of burning fossil fuels – are becoming more hostile to vital marine life. “Since ocean acidification happens extremely fast compared to natural processes, only organisms with short generation times, such as micro-organisms, are able to keep up,” the authors of the study Exploring Ocean Change: Biological Impacts of Ocean Acidification found. Marine life such as crustaceans and organisms that create calcified shelters for themselves in the oceans were thought to be most at risk, because acid seas would hinder them forming shells. However, the research shows that while these are in danger, perhaps surprisingly, some – such as barnacles – are often unaffected, while the damage from acidification is also felt much higher up the food chain, into big food fish species. Ocean acidification can reduce the survival prospects of some species early in their lives, with knock-on effects. For instance, the scientists found that by the end of the century, the size of Atlantic cod in the Baltic and Barents Sea might be reduced to only a quarter of the size they are today, because of acidification. Peter Thomson, UN ambassador for the oceans and a diplomat from Fiji, which is hosting this year’s UN climate change conference in Bonn, urged people to think of the oceans in the same terms as they do the climate. “We are all aware of climate change, but we need to talk more about ocean change, and the effects of acidification, warming, plastic pollution, dead zones and so on,” he said. “The world must know that we have a plan to save the ocean. What is required over the next three years is concerted action.” The eight-year study was carried out by the Biological Impacts of Ocean Acidification group (known as Bioacid), a German network of researchers, with the support of the German government, and involved more than 250 scientists investigating how marine life is responding to acidification, and examining research from around the world. The study was initiated well before governmentssigned a global agreement on climate change at Paris in 2015, and highlights how the Paris agreement to hold warming to no more than 2C may not be enough to prevent further acidification of the world’s seas. Governments will meet in Bonn in November to discuss the next steps on the road to fulfilling the requirements of the Paris agreement, and the researchers are hoping to persuade attendees to take action on ocean acidification as well. Ocean acidification is another effect of pouring carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, as the gas dissolves in seawater to produce weak carbonic acid. Since the industrial revolution, the average pH of the ocean has been found to have fallen from 8.2 to 8.1, which may seem small but corresponds to an increase in acidity of about 26%. Measures to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide reaching the atmosphere can help to slow down this process, but only measures that actively remove carbon already in the atmosphere will halt it, because of the huge stock of carbon already in the air from the burning of fossil fuels. Worse still, the effects of acidification can intensify the effects of global warming, in a dangerous feedback loop. The researchers pointed to a form of planktonic alga known as Emiliania huxleyi, which in laboratory experiments was able to adapt to some extent to counter the negative effects acidification had upon it. But in a field experiment, the results were quite different as the extra stresses present at sea meant it was not able to form the extensive blooms it naturally develops. As these blooms help to transport carbon dioxide from the surface to the deep ocean, and produce the gas dimethyl sulfide that can help suppress global warming, a downturn in this species “will therefore severely feed back on the climate system”.\n",

      "Text: Last year was the seventh worst on record for butterflies in Britain, and for two declining butterfly species it was their worst since records began. Fewer grayling and grizzled skippers took to the skies than in any year since the scientific monitoring of butterflies began more than 40 years ago. The annual UK Butterfly Monitoring scheme revealed that seven of the worst 10 years for butterflies have occurred this century. While long-term falls in butterfly populations have been caused by habitat loss, scientists attribute the dramatic recent decline to climate change, pesticides such as neonicotinoids and nitrogen pollution. While it was hoped that a brighter spring in 2017 would see butterfly populations bounce back after the virtually butterfly-less late summer of 2016, many of Britain’s 59 native species, both rare and common, suffered further falls. Grizzled skipper numbers have more than halved since the 1970s while the grayling’s population has shrunk by 63% in the last decade. The large white – once so common it was a pest – fell by 19% in 2017. There was some good news, with two species enjoying long-term increases once again experiencing good summers: the red admiral was up by 78% compared to 2016 and the comma rose by 91%. A warm spring and targeted conservation management for a rare butterfly, the pearl-bordered fritillary, also reaped dividends, with a 57% increase on 2016. “Butterflies are at a low ebb, and going from one bad year to another, not helped by the weather which is all over the place,” said Prof Tom Brereton, head of monitoring at Butterfly Conservation. “A lot of climate change research has focused on average increases in temperature, which should be beneficial to many butterflies but the variable and extreme weather that comes with climate change is having a negative effect and disrupting butterflies.” Increased nitrogen deposition – via agricultural fertilisers but also pollution from motor vehicles – is highly likely to be causing the disappearance of butterflies such as the grayling and grizzled skipper, according to Brereton. The caterpillars of such species feed on plants which are easily swamped by more vigorous grasses, which thrive in high-nitrogen conditions. “The conservation management has not really changed on sites such as nature reserves but the vegetation has subtly changed – it’s grassed over, or become taller and shadier,” said Brereton. “It’s not surprising that insects like the grayling, wall brown and grizzled skipper are struggling.” Brereton led research which last year uncovered surprisingly high declines of butterflies in urban areas, where vehicle pollution has caused nitrogen levels to soar. “There does seem to be a correlation between butterflies that have a low nitrogen status and their declines in areas of high nitrogen deposition,” said Brereton. “There is some evidence of this from the Netherlands but more research is needed.” Butterflies have been scientifically recorded since 1976 by thousands of volunteers for the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, a partnership between Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. 1.2008 2.1981 3.2012 4.2016 5.2007 6.1977 7.2017 8.2001 9.2002 10.1988\n",

      "Text: Australia’s parliament has passed the country’s most significant emissions reduction legislation in more than a decade after the government won backing from Greens and independent MPs for a plan to deal with pollution from major industrial sites. After weeks of closed-door negotiation, a deal was brokered between the Labor government and Greens, a minor party with 15 parliamentarians, that included legislating an explicit requirement that total emissions from major industrial facilities must come down, not just be offset. Australia is the world’s third biggest fossil fuel exporter. The Greens argued the deal would stop some new gas and coal development proposals, but acknowledged it would not prevent further industry expansion. The deal to pass changes to the policy known as the safeguard mechanism is considered key to prime minister Anthony Albanese’s commitment to cut national carbon dioxide emissions 43% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. From 1 July, many of the country’s 215 major polluting facilities – including fossil fuel operations, other mines, refineries and smelters – will need to cut emissions intensity by 5% a year, either through absolute cuts or by buying contentious carbon offsets. Together, they are responsible for about 30% of emissions in Australia. While individual companies can buy an unlimited number of offsets, total absolute emissions under the scheme cannot increase and are required to come down over time. New gas fields opened for export project must offset all CO2 emissions, increasing costs for developers. Labor had rejected an initial offer from the Greens to support the bill if the government agreed to ban new coal and gas developments in line with scientific warnings. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, hailed the deal as a “landmark reform” that delivered on a promise to reverse nearly a decade of inaction on the climate crisis under the rightwing Coalition administration that held power from 2013 until last year. He said it would lead to a 205m tonne reduction in emissions by 2030, which he described as equivalent to taking two-thirds of the nation’s cars off the road. “Today is an historic day for the country to ensure our economy can take advantage of the opportunities of decarbonisation and meet our ambitious climate targets,” Bowen said. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, described negotiating with the government as “like negotiating with the political wing” of coal and gas companies, but said fossil fuels had “taken a huge hit”. “To everyone who is despairing about the future and wants real climate action, today you should have a spring in your step, because it shows we can take on the coal and gas corporations and win,” Bandt said. “The fight is not over, because in the middle of a climate crisis, Labor still wants to open more coal and gas.” The legislation was opposed by the rightwing Liberal-National Coalition, despite it having introduced the safeguard mechanism in 2016. It initially promised the safeguard would stop industrial emissions increasing, but in practice often allowed companies to emit beyond onsite limits without penalty. The Coalition’s climate change spokesperson, Ted O’Brien, said the changes to the scheme made it a “carbon tax by stealth” that would “decapitate” the economy. But the policy won broad support from major business and industry groups. Environment groups also supported the deal, but called on the government to stop allowing developments that expanded Australia’s fossil fuel exports.\n",

People who care about the subject, which you’d think would be most people considering what is at stake, struggled to maintain a rational conversation, given that the former government’s policy had been taken down by rhetorical nonsense – Whyalla wipeouts and $100 lamb roasts and the like – and the Abbott government’s still sketchy policy was propped up by the same. But eventually facts challenge nonsense rhetoric, and the past nine months have made it clear just how untenable Australia’s position is. Here are seven sadly ridiculous things about our current situation. Climate policy is complicated, but it’s also really simple. We have to find a way to gradually reduce emissions, including from industry, transport and electricity generation. Most experts think some kind of carbon price is the most cost-effective way. There are other ways – direct government regulation, for example. But trying to hide this basic goal behind a smokescreen of rhetoric or the creative manipulation of complicated concepts and numbers cannot avoid the inevitable.\n",

      "Text: Australia’s gas industry has launched a major public relations campaign to convince the public of three things: their product is clean, indispensable to our lives and crucial in getting the country to net zero. With soft, seductive and reassuring voiceovers, a TV ad shows images of hospitals, farms and city lights with the tagline “Natural gas: keeping the country running.” Running the campaign is the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea), whose chief executive, Samantha McCulloch, said the idea was to raise the public’s awareness of the “critical role of gas”. On the campaign website, there are “facts” – lots of them – several of which are only partly true, cherrypicked or ignore the role of fossil gas in loading the atmosphere with methane and CO2 in the middle of a climate crisis that will only get worse with more fossil fuels. So let’s do what any self-respecting factcheck column would do and go and do some factchecking. “As Australia shuts down coal, gas is picking up the load,” the gas industry says in the advert. “It will help keep Australia running as we transition to a cleaner future,” the ad claims. In a fact sheet, Appea says the “share of gas-fired power generation in Australia’s electricity mix more than doubled between 2000-01 and 2020-21”. The source for that statistic is the government’s Australian Energy Update 2022 report, and taken across two decades, the data agrees with Appea. But in the most recent decade, the same report says gas-fired generation has grown by just 0.2%. The report says: “Natural gas-fired generation in 2020–21 fell nationally to the lowest level in a decade, and in the southern and eastern states which constitute the National Electricity Market, fell to the lowest level seen since the early 2000s.” That is not a story of surging gas-fired power as the Appea campaign suggests, but a flatlining – and remember, too, that more than 80% of the gas produced in Australia is not consumed by Australians at all, but is used for the export of LNG. In Appea’s television advert, a voiceover says gas is “one of Australia’s main sources for generating electricity”. A fact sheet asks: “What makes that electricity powering Australian homes?” and then says “about a fifth of the electricity we use” comes from burning gas. Right now, about 18% of the electricity generated in Australia comes from gas, according to government statistics. But this figure is heavily skewed by Western Australia, which accounts for half of all gas-fired power generation despite having only 10% of the country’s population. Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, says in the National Electricity Market (covering 90% of the population, that is, everywhere except Western Australia and the Northern Territory) gas generation has fallen about 45% since 2014. In this current financial year so far, gas has been responsible for only 5.6% of electricity generation in the NEM – less than coal, wind, solar and hydro. So if you live anywhere but WA or the NT, then gas doesn’t account for “about a fifth” of the electricity you use, but more like “an eighteenth” – which isn’t quite as impressive. Mark Ogge, a principal adviser at The Australia Institute, says the amount of gas-fired electricity used by Australians in their homes is likely even less, because “gas industry uses around one-fifth of the electricity generated in Australia to run its LNG export terminals”. “So really, [Appea] is claiming electricity generation has increased largely because the gas industry is using more electricity to export Australia’s gas.” The Appea advert says gas “will help keep Australia running as we transition to a cleaner future”. The Australian Energy Market Operator’s main plan to decarbonise the NEM does say gas will have an important role as a standby in case of shortages in solar, wind, hydro power and battery storage. The plan says that by 2050, there will be about the same amount of gas-fired capacity then as there is now. But the word “capacity” should not be confused with how much gas will actually be used. Dr Dylan McConnell, an energy systems analyst at the University of New South Wakes, says the most recent forecast from AEMO says that by 2040, the actual amount of gas being used for power generation will be about one-third of what it was in 2015. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup One of the central facts in Appea’s campaign is that gas is “50% cleaner” than coal (which, as McConnell says, would be great if we only needed to reduce emissions by 50%). Appea says the source for this fact is an International Energy Agency report on gas and a 2017 report on the future of the electricity market from former chief scientist Dr Alan Finkel. Hare says more up-to-date data from the NEM shows gas has 61% of the emissions of coal for each unit of power generated, not 50%. But there are other issues here. Comparing the emissions of gas to coal is moot because Australia has very likely built its last coal-fired power plant. Those coal plants still running are being turned off. Tristan Edis, an energy analyst at Green Energy Markets, says it is renewables that are replacing coal, not gas. He said: “How is it possible that gas is replacing coal, when gas is declining? It’s a logical impossibility. The only thing that’s increasing is wind and solar generation.” So the most pertinent comparison to the emissions of gas should be to renewables. McConnell points to industry data used by Aemo for new gas-fired power that might come into the system, showing the cleanest plants would emit about 377kg of CO2 for every unit of power produced (not counting emissions from extraction, transportation and any leaks of methane along the way). That compares with essentially zero for renewables (again, not counting for energy used to make and transport the turbines or solar panels). Appea’s campaign might leave the average viewer with the idea that gas is indispensable. The campaign has a laundry list of products and processes that currently use gas – everything from producing fabrics to powering hospitals and providing hot showers (many of which can be done without the need for burning fossil gas). In one fact sheet, the campaign uses a quote from Prof Michael Brear, director of the Melbourne Energy Institute, that says an “all technology hands on deck approach” will be needed for Australia to reach net zero, and this will include doubling the capacity of gas-fired electricity generation to support renewables. The quote was taken from a media release about the results of a major effort to model a net zero future for Australia which includes all energy use in the country – not just for generating electricity. So what does that report say about gas? All five of the net zero scenarios show gas use declining in Australia. When it comes to energy exported, only one scenario shows a growth in gas exports. But that scenario assumes a domestic carbon capture and storage (CCS) industry will emerge, and will have the capacity to store 1100Mt of CO2 every year. Is that a lot? For context, that is more than 25 times the amount of CCS storage that is currently operational around the globe. Hare says: “Appea makes strong and hyperbolic claims as to the importance of gas for economic activities but does not at all discuss the potential for replacement of gas through efficiency and electrification. “All sectors have opportunities to replace gas, including those that are most carbon-intensive, through improved efficiency, changes in processes and electrification with renewable power.”\n",

      "Text: A tsunami of electric vehicles is expected in rich countries, as car companies and governments pledge to ramp up their numbers – there are predicted be 145m on the roads by 2030. But while electric vehicles can play an important role in reducing emissions, they also contain a potential environmental timebomb: their batteries. By one estimate, more than 12m tons of lithium-ion batteries are expected to retire between now and 2030. Not only do these batteries require large amounts of raw materials, including lithium, nickel and cobalt – mining for which has climate, environmental and human rights impacts – they also threaten to leave a mountain of electronic waste as they reach the end of their lives. As the automotive industry starts to transform, experts say now is the time to plan for what happens to batteries at the end of their lives, to reduce reliance on mining and keep materials in circulation. Hundreds of millions of dollars are flowing into recycling startups and research centers to figure out how to disassemble dead batteries and extract valuable metals at scale. But if we want to do more with the materials that we have, recycling shouldn’t be the first solution, said James Pennington, who leads the World Economic Forum’s circular economy program. “The best thing to do at first is to keep things in use for longer,” he said. “There is a lot of [battery] capacity left at the end of first use in electric vehicles,” said Jessika Richter, who researches environmental policy at Lund University. These batteries may no longer be able run vehicles but they could have second lives storing excess power generated by solar or windfarms. Several companies are running trials. The energy company Enel Group is using 90 batteries retired from Nissan Leaf cars in an energy storage facility in Melilla, Spain, which is isolated from the Spanish national grid. In the UK, the energy company Powervault partnered with Renault to outfit home energy storage systems with retired batteries. Establishing the flow of lithium-ion batteries from a first life in electric vehicles to a second life in stationary energy storage would have another bonus: displacing toxic lead-acid batteries. Only about 60% of lead-acid batteries are used in cars, said Richard Fuller, who leads the non-profit Pure Earth, another 20% are used for storing excess solar power, particularly in African countries. Lead-acid batteries typically last only about two years in warmer climates, said Fuller, as heat causes them to degrade more quickly, meaning they need to be recycled frequently. However, there are few facilities that can safely do this in Africa. Instead, these batteries are often cracked open and melted down in back yards. The process exposes the recyclers and their surroundings to lead, a potent neurotoxin that has no known safe level and can damage brain development in children. Lithium-ion batteries could offer a less toxic and longer-lasting alternative for energy storage, Fuller said. “When a battery really is at the end of its use, then it’s time to recycle it,” Pennington said. There is big momentum behind lithium-ion battery recycling. In its impact report, published in August, Tesla announced that it had started building recycling capabilities at its Gigafactory in Nevada to process waste batteries. Nearby Redwood Materials, founded by the former Tesla chief technology officer JB Straubel, which operates out of Carson City, Nevada, raised more than $700m in July and plans to expand operations. The factory takes in dead batteries, extracts valuable materials such as copper and cobalt, then sends the refined metals back into the battery supply chain. Yet, as recycling becomes more mainstream, big technical challenges remain. One of which is the complex designs that recyclers must navigate to get to the valuable components. Lithium-ion batteries are rarely designed with recyclability in mind, said Carlton Cummins, co-founder of Aceleron, a UK battery manufacturing startup. “This is why the recycler struggles. They want to do the job, but they only get introduced to the product when it reaches their door.” Cummins and co-founder Amrit Chandan have targeted one design flaw: the way components are connected. Most components are welded together, which is good for electrical connection, but bad for recycling, Cummins said. Aceleron’s batteries join components with fasteners that compress the metal contacts together. These connections can be decompressed and the fasteners removed, allowing for complete disassembly or for the removal and replacement of individual faulty components. Easier disassembly could also help mitigate safety hazards. Lithium-ion batteries that are not properly handled could pose fire and explosion risks. “If we pick it down to bits, I guarantee you, it’s not going to hurt anyone,” Cummins said. Success isn’t guaranteed even if the technical challenges are cracked. History shows how hard it can be to create well-functioning recycling industries. Lead-acid batteries, for example, enjoy high rates of recycling in part due to legal requirements – as much as 99% of lead in automobile batteries is recycled. But they have a toxic cost when they end up at improper recycling facilities. Spent batteries often end up with backyard recyclers because they can pay more for them than formal recyclers, who have to cover higher operating costs. Lithium-ion batteries may be less toxic but they will still need to end up at operations that can safely recycle them. “Products tend to flow through the path of least resistance, so you want to make the path which goes through formal channels less resistant,” Pennington said. Legislation could help. While the US has yet to implement federal policies mandating lithium-ion battery recycling, the EU and China already require battery manufacturers to pay for setting up collection and recycling systems. These funds could help subsidize formal recyclers to make them more competitive, Pennington said. Last December, the EU also proposed sweeping changes to its battery regulations, most of which target lithium-ion batteries. These include target rates of 70% for battery collection, recovery rates of 95% for cobalt, copper, lead and nickel and 70% for lithium, and mandatory minimum levels of recycled content in new batteries by 2030 – to ensure there are markets for recyclers and buffer them from volatile commodity prices or changing battery chemistries. “They aren’t in final form yet, but the proposals that are out there are ambitious,” Richter said. Data could also help. The EU and the Global Battery Alliance (GBA), a public-private collaboration, are both working on versions of a digital “passport” – an electronic record for a battery that would contain information about its whole life cycle. “We are thinking about a QR code or a [radio frequency identification] detection device,” says Torsten Freund, who leads the GBA’s battery passport initiative. It could report a battery’s health and remaining capacity, helping vehicle manufacturers direct it for reuse or to recycling facilities. Data about materials could help recyclers navigate the myriad chemistries of lithium-ion batteries. And once recycling becomes more widespread, the passport could also indicate the amount of recycled content in new batteries. As the automobile industry starts to transform, now is the time to tackle these problems, said Maya Ben Dror, urban mobility lead at the World Economic Forum. The money pouring into the sector offers an “opportunity to ensure that these investments are going to be in sustainable new ecosystems and not just in a new type of car”, she said. It’s also worth noting that sustainable transport goes beyond electric cars, said Richter. Walking, biking or taking public transportation should not be overlooked, she said. “It’s important to remember that we can have a sustainable product situated within an unsustainable system.”\n",

      "Text: You report that the campaign group RePlanet has called for the European Union to ditch its organic targets “in favour of conventional and intensive farming techniques for higher productivity” (Halt use of biofuels to ease food crisis, says green group, 13 July). However, its call is based on a myth: despite receiving less than 1% of global agricultural research funding and just 5% of the $700bn in annual agricultural subsidies, agroecology practices such as organic farming are associated with as good and often higher productivity as well as enhanced biodiversity, resilience to climate shocks such as drought, reduced operating greenhouse gas emissions (a third of which are now produced by the food system) and higher levels of atmospheric carbon absorbed back into soils. With chemical fertiliser prices doubling or trebling, condemning European food systems to dependency on hyper-expensive chemical inputs – much of them imported from major global chemical fertiliser exporters such as Russia and Belarus – makes about as much sense as tying our energy system to hyper-expensive fossil fuels from the same countries when renewables have never been cheaper and solar power is now, according to the International Energy Agency, “the cheapest source of electricity in history”.Richard EwbankLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

      "Text: The government is to use the expansion of London’s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) to go on the attack over what it has called “Labour’s war on motorists”, part of a wider battle against green policies it hopes could prove popular with voters. With the extension of the clean air scheme to every London borough beginning at midnight on Monday, Sadiq Khan, the capital’s Labour mayor, said that while the decision was difficult, the devastating health effects of toxic exhausts trumped other considerations. In what could be seen as a coded swipe against Keir Starmer, who pressured the mayor to pause the extension of the £12.50 daily charge for using a heavily polluting vehicle, Khan said he wanted to be “a doer, not a delayer”. “The easiest thing for me to do would have been to kick the can down the road, but we simply don’t have time to waste,” he said. Despite Starmer’s ambivalence about Ulez and mooted clean air schemes in other cities, ministers plan to directly link the expansion to the Labour leader, echoing the tactics that helped the Tories to an unexpected win in July’s Uxbridge byelection. The extended clean air zone “is the latest salvo in Labour’s war on motorists”, said the transport secretary, Mark Harper, who will be dispatched on to Tuesday morning’s broadcast round to amplify the message. “From a ban on road building in Wales to a tax on the poorest motorists in London and secret Labour plans to make drivers pay per mile – the realities of Labour politicians in positions of power are ideological policies that hit hardworking motorists hard,” he said. The reference to road pricing follows a report at the weekend saying Khan and Transport for London (TfL) have explored ways to implement a pay-per-mile road levy, something the mayor has said is not being planned. A spokesperson for Khan said he “has been crystal clear – a pay per mile scheme is not on the table and not on his agenda”. Such schemes have been considered as a possibility by TfL, including when Boris Johnson was mayor, and by the Treasury, as officials explore ways to tackle a looming fiscal shortfall from diminishing fuel duty revenues as drivers switch to electric vehicles. While the Uxbridge result was not wholly encouraging for the government – the 7,000-plus majority Johnson had won in the seat in 2019 plummeted to below 500 – the narrow win has prompted Rishi Sunak to ditch some green policies and seek to portray Labour as eco-zealots with a dislike of drivers. In the aftermath of the Uxbridge vote, Sunak and Harper announced a review of low-traffic neighbourhoods, filters that aim to increase walking and cycling on quieter streets, which the prime minister described as “anti-motorist”. A key test of the anti-green agenda will be whether ministers and friendly newspapers are able to keep the Ulez expansion in the headlines, given that coverage and complaints gradually diminish after the implementation of such schemes. Devised by Johnson and implemented under Khan, Ulez initially covered just inner London and was initially extended in 2021. The further expansion is seen as more controversial, as outer suburbs have a less dense public transport network and a greater reliance on cars. Khan has fought back against Sunak, saying the prime minister’s stance had “put decades of progress on clean air into reverse” and risked “stunting the lungs” of London’s children. The mayor, who has received no central government help, has committed £160m to a scrappage scheme to help drivers of older vehicles upgrade, a programme that was expanded and made more generous earlier this month. Khan’s office said that in the last week alone there had been more than 15,000 applications for the scheme, totalling £6m in funds. While Harper called the Ulez expansion a “money grab”, Khan’s office says any net revenue will be invested in public transport, including better bus services in outer London. As the proportion of compliant vehicles increases, revenue will drop, and the scheme is forecast to only cover its costs by 2026-27. Khan said the expansion was “a landmark day for our city which will lead to a greener, healthier London for everyone”.\n",

      "Text: A key Cop27 goal was to strengthen emission pledges made at last year’s climate summit in Glasgow. These are needed to ensure global heating is limited to 1.5C. No such commitments have been made in Egypt and most observers now conclude the world is destined to heat beyond this limit. “I struggle to understand how anyone can continue to argue that 1.5C is still alive,” said James Dyke, from Exeter University’s Global Systems Institute. “We are now entering a much warmer and more dangerous world.” This point was backed by Professor Kevin Anderson at Manchester University’s Tyndall Centre. “A year on from the Glasgow Cop26, a further 40bn tonnes of carbon dioxide has been spewed into the atmosphere. Another miserable facade of climate concern grinds to its ‘groundhog’ end.” As expected, Cop27 was dominated by arguments about climate compensation due to poorer countries. Global warming has been caused by industrial nations who used fossil fuels to enrich themselves. They should therefore reimburse countries who are suffering most from climate change. Such “loss and damage” claims include Pakistan’s recent $30bn bill for its flooding. Hopes were raised that a deal might be in the offing but confusion surrounds details of the agreement. “The one bright spot at Cop27 has been a renewed seriousness around loss and damage, with hundreds of millions committed via various schemes,” said geographer Laurie Parsons, from Royal Holloway, London University. “Major concerns remain, however. The total funding required for adaptation is at least $2.5 trillion by 2030, so we are still orders of magnitude out.” Global heating threatens to devastate habitats across the world, putting thousands of species in danger of extinction. These range from polar bears and tigers to monarch butterflies and sea turtles. However, the most spectacular threat is the one faced by the planet’s coral reefs which provide habitats for thousand of species. Planetary heating of 1.5C will see between 70 and 90% of coral reefs disappear. At 2C, 99% will be destroyed. Threats like these will be debated intensively at Cop15, the UN biodiversity summit next month. However, no mention of the conference has been made in Egypt despite the strong link between climate change and species loss. On the other hand, a more positive note was struck by the arrival of Lula da Silva, the new Brazilian president, who pledged to do everything to save his country’s rainforests – in contrast to previous years’ gloom about their fate. Hopes were raised at Cop27 that serious reductions could be made in humanity’s burning of coal, gas and oil, the major causes of climate change. This optimism sprang from India’s call for fossil fuel burning to phased down – though not phasing out, it should be noted. But the proposal has not led to major follow ups and the issue has not yet been resolved. “It’s now about damage limitation,” said Professor Richard Betts of the UK Met Office. “We should all still work much harder to reduce emissions urgently to keep further heating of the planet as low as possible while also adapting to the changes we have already caused.” Minimising the heating of our planet by attempting to limit carbon emissions is only one way to tackle global heating. The world also needs to adapt so it is less vulnerable to the floods, droughts, sea level rises and crop disasters that lie ahead as the planet heats up. These adaptations would come in the form of better flood defences, seawalls, moving communities to higher ground and protecting road and rail links from storms and inundations. Some improvements to previous commitments have been suggested at Cop27, with reports indicating a doubling of funding for adaptation could be agreed. However, scientists again warn that levels of promised fundings still lie well below the investments that will be needed in the near future.\n",

      "Text: The financial crisis and recession across Europe have not put people off fighting climate change, a new poll for the European Commission has shown. It found the number of people supporting a “green economy” has risen in the past three years. At least two thirds of people in all EU member states said that transforming the economy on to a green footing, by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in green technologies, would boost the economy and reduce unemployment. Even in those member states that have suffered the worst effects of the financial crisis and recession, a large majority are of the opinion that energy efficiency and moves to a greener economy could be beneficial. Nearly nine in ten over respondents in Greece, Spain and Portugal said they believed that fighting climate change and using energy more efficiently would boost the economy and jobs. Across the EU, about seven in ten people think that reducing the EU’s fossil fuel imports – that run to more than half a billion euros a year – would be a good idea. The results came in a survey conducted by Eurobarometer, the pan-EU polling service, and published on Monday. Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, said that the imperatives of cutting greenhouse gas emissions and improving the economy need not be mutually exclusive. “Cost-effective climate action is indeed good economics. I am very encouraged that European citizens recognise that too. This poll sends a strong signal to EU leaders to take bold climate action for a sustainable economic recovery.” Connie Hedegaard, the EU’s climate chief, said: “The poll confirms a clear majority of Europeans expect their politicians to tackle the climate challenge now. [They] understand that climate chnge did not go away while their governments were busy handling the economic crisis. It is not either growth and competitiveness or the climate: it is both, it has to be both.” In the UK, just over a third of people polled identified poverty, hunger and lack of clean drinking water as the most serious problems facing the world, while about 14% said the growing world population was most serious. One in eight people said climate change was the most pressing problem. About 55% of people in the UK said tackling climate change was mainly the responsibility of national governments, while about 29% said business and industry should bear most of the responsibility.\n",

      "Text: Erna Solberg, the Norwegian Prime Minister, has called on the world to immediately set a global carbon price and phase out fossil fuel subsidies in order to better drive investment in low carbon technologies. Speaking at a conference hosted by the Norwegian British Chamber of Commerce in London today, Solberg argued Norway’s 26 year old carbon tax had been crucial in helping to drive development of “climate friendly” technologies. In what could be interpreted as a thinly veiled attack on the UK government’s recent shake up of clean energy policies, Solberg said it was the job of governments to provide a stable policy framework to allow businesses to confidently invest in low carbon technologies. She also argued that the global effort to tackle climate change required dugnad - a Norwegian term best translated as voluntary work best done through a joint effort. “The active participation of business and industry will be crucial,” she said. “The government should, and will, be a partner and active facilitator. But, as with a traditional dugnad, we all have different roles to play. In our view, the main role of the government in the green transition is to ensure a predictable framework and a level playing field for innovation, industry and enterprise. And, most importantly, to provide clear direction.” Solberg argued a carbon tax would prove a key mechanism in providing a stable investment environment for clean technologies and called for the United Nations to agree to a global carbon price at the Paris climate change summit next month. While the Paris summit could provide a boost to existing carbon markets and pave the way for a market mechanism for tackling emissions from emissions and shipping, a global carbon price agreement remains unlikely. However, growing numbers of political and business leaders, including a group of influential fossil fuel companies, have recently stepped up call for a global carbon pricing policy. “Norway has had a carbon tax in place for a long time,” Solberg said, rejecting the argument carbon pricing could damage economies. “This has not slowed down industrial development. Rather, it has encouraged innovation and the development of solutions that reduce emissions and bring down operating costs. “On a global level, if there was ever a time when we should put a price on carbon emissions and phase out fossil fuel subsidies, it is now.” Despite Norway’s ambitious action on climate change, the government has been criticised recently by campaigners for it’s continued push to explore oil reserves in the Arctic. In an open letter to Solberg published on Huffington Post this week, climate scientist James Hansen, warned that Norway’s decision to award licenses in the Barents Sea could harm ecosystems most vulnerable to climate change. “What Norway chooses to do in the Arctic can have a massive effect - for better or worse,” he wrote. “We still have a small window of opportunity to avoid climate tipping points and stabilise the climate, but not if the race to exploit Arctic oil reserves continues unchecked.”\n",

      "Text: All state and territory governments should introduce bans on gas connections in new homes and develop a clear plan to electrify existing properties and small businesses, according to an organisation representing energy consumers. In a submission to a Senate inquiry examining Australia’s residential electrification efforts, Energy Consumers Australia urged the government to consider mandatory information disclosures to warn consumers about “the potential economic consequences” of buying a new gas appliance. The organisation’s chief executive, Dr Brendan French, said its most recent consumer research found 22% of consumers were planning to decarbonise and make their homes all-electric, up from 16% in 2021. But he said there were still too many barriers for making the switch, particularly for low-income households, renters and residents of multi-unit dwellings. Recent modelling Energy Consumers Australia commissioned from the CSIRO found that even without solar panels and a battery, households could reduce their annual energy bills by $2,250 by 2030 if they swapped to electric appliances and an electric vehicle. Solar panels and a battery increased the projected saving to $3,500. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “While this is great news for many consumers, people who face barriers to going all-electric could be left behind and unable to access those savings,” French said. “Governments must make sure those who can least afford to make the switch don’t end up shackled to a fossil fuel gas network that becomes more and more costly for fewer and fewer people.” The organisation’s submission said the electrification of homes required national planning that involved all levels of government. It recommended the Albanese government expand its household energy upgrades fund to support more homes and social housing. It also called for further grants and subsidies for low-income households and agreed with a recent Grattan Institute report that urged state and territory governments to set end dates for the use of gas in homes. It points to Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory as jurisdictions with policies that gave “certainty and direction to both industry and consumers” as economies decarbonise. In June, the ACT Labor-Greens minority government became the first Australian jurisdiction to introduce legislation prohibiting the use of fossil gas in new homes and businesses. The Victorian Labor government announced it would phase out gas connections for new dwellings from 2024. But in New South Wales, the Minns Labor government has ruled out a ban on new gas connections. The Albanese government has identified energy efficiency in homes and other buildings as low-hanging fruit for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and taking pressure off energy bills. Budget measures included $1.3bn to establish the household energy upgrades fund, $300m to support upgrades to social housing and $310m for tax deductions for small and medium business that spend money on electrification and energy efficiency. The government is also developing a national energy performance strategy. The assistant minister for climate change and energy, Jenny McAllister, said the government’s approach to energy upgrades and efficiency was to “give Australians choices”. “We are taking action to drive down household and business energy costs and make homes and businesses cheaper to run,” McAllister said. “The Albanese government has no plans to ban new gas connections to people’s homes. State and territories can consider the future of gas connections in their jurisdictions.” The independent MP for Wentworth, Allegra Spender, said new modelling she had commissioned by the parliamentary budget office found more than 10,000 additional hot water heat-pumps, induction cooktops, and energy-efficient reverse-cycle space heating would be installed if landlords could immediately write-off the cost of the upgrades against tax. Spender is proposing the tax incentive for landlords, which she said would flow on to renters in the form of energy savings of between $514 and $1,594 each year. She said many renters were locked out of lower power bills because they were reliant on landlords to make energy upgrades. “This tax break would substantially change the financial incentives facing landlords and ensure that tens of thousands switch their properties to cheaper, greener and healthier electrical appliances when old gas appliances need replacing.”\n",

      "Text: The world’s first detailed route map to ending a nation’s use of fossil fuels is both “ambitious and affordable”, according to the UK government’s official advisers, and would see half of the cars on the road being electric by 2030 and 10,000 giant wind turbines in the North Sea. The Climate Change Committee’s analysis found that the future cost savings from no longer having to buy oil and gas almost offsets the £50bn-a-year investment needed in low-carbon power, transport and home heating across the next three decades. The eyes of the world are on the UK as it prepares to host a critical UN summit to tackle the climate crisis next November and UK leadership is considered vital for success. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, recently announced a green industrial revolution plan, but the CCC said further action was needed now from the government to set the UK on the path to ending emissions by 2050. The CCC route map forecast people’s energy bills remaining level, before falling after 2030 as cheap renewable energy expands. Electric cars will also save drivers money but a phase-out of gas boilers will mean some households will require government help to install more expensive low-carbon heating systems, the CCC said. The plan envisages air travel staying near current levels and meat eating, which is already falling, being reduced by just 20% by 2030. Changes in how people live “need not entail sacrifices”, the CCC said. It said mixed woodlands covering an area three times the size of Greater London should be planted by 2035, capturing CO2 and providing new green spaces. The cost of offshore wind power has plummeted in recent years and the CCC sees it as “the backbone of the whole UK energy system”, with all electricity being renewable or nuclear by 2035. The UK will become an electric nation, the CCC said, with double the current amount of power being generated by 2050, but with hydrogen expanding to fuel heavy industry and transport and warm some homes. The CCC also set out a new carbon budget for the UK for 2035, as required by law. CO2 emissions are to reduced by 78% compared with 1990 levels, equivalent to cutting two-thirds of today’s emissions. The CCC said this advanced carbon cuts by 15 years compared with plans in 2018, reflecting falling green costs. Getting to net zero emissions is “ambitious, realistic and affordable”, said Lord Deben, chair of the CCC. “The price is manifestly reasonable. It will be the private sector that will do much of the investment but it will be the government that sets the tone.” “It now has to set out in detail the steps required,” he said. “As we emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic, this is a chance to jump-start the UK’s economic recovery.” But Deben added the costs of the transition must be distributed fairly across society. The government has accepted all previous carbon budgets proposed by the CCC and has until June 2021 to accept the new one. The CCC analysis found it is cheaper to transition to electric cars and vans than to continue with petrol and diesel vehicles. “That’s an amazing new insight, because it has major implications for the overall cost of achieving net zero,” said Chris Stark, chief executive of the CCC. The annual net cost across the 30 years to 2050 is £10bn, or about 0.5% of GDP, the CCC said. This does not include the benefits of new jobs or better health as air pollution and damp, cold homes are reduced. Today, poor housing alone costs the NHS £1.5bn a year. “It’s now clear that – at worst – we’ve got a very small cost overall in order to unlock those very big benefits of tackling climate change,” said Stark. Alison Doig, at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “The report demonstrates that taking bold action makes sense for jobs and prosperity, but also keeps the UK at the forefront of an international zero carbon revolution. The government can show it is serious about delivering the goals of the Paris agreement by taking [the CCC] advice.” Prof Rob Gross, director of the UK Energy Research Centre, said the CCC reports were hugely significant. But he said the major expansion of both renewable energy and electric cars would be challenging: “The speed with which we would need to get charging stations sorted out is a real challenge, if we are to avoid alienating motorists.” Clara Goldsmith, at the Climate Coalition, said: “The government must accept this advice and unleash a decade of ambitious action. There is no downside to embracing this plan. It can transform our society and create hundreds of thousands of green jobs.” Doug Parr, at Greenpeace UK, said: “The CCC may have set out its paths to net zero but we’ll need much more legwork from the government over this parliament to reach it. While some progress has been made recently there remains a yawning gap between our targets over the next decade and action needed to meet them.” Stark said the climate crisis was worsening, with global CO2 emissions and temperature still on an upward trend: “We are in a bad place.” But he said 2021 would be a big year for action in the UK, with government strategies due for heat and buildings, food, aviation, hydrogen and trees and peat bogs. “It is the actions to deliver [net zero emissions] that are important now.”  This article was amended on 9 December 2020 to refer to Rob Gross’s principal job, of director of the UK Energy Research Centre, rather than his role as director of the Centre for Energy Policy and Technology.\n",

      "Text: The Australian energy giant Woodside is spending $7bn to drill for 479m barrels-worth of oil and gas off the coast of Mexico, but it says this is all in line with keeping global heating to 1.5C. How? Woodside has said it “aims to thrive through the energy transition by building a low-cost, lower-carbon, profitable, resilient and diversified portfolio”. It has a 60% stake in the development, known as Trion, alongside Mexico’s state-owned oil exploration and production company, Pemex. Pemex discovered the oil and gas 2.5km deep, about 180km off shore in the Gulf of Mexico. There will be 24 wells and Pemex and Woodside are planning for the first oil to be pumped in 2028. Announcing the investment, Woodside pointed to analysis carried out for the UN’s climate science panel that it said showed there were “a range of future energy transition pathways” that allowed for new supply of fossil fuels while keeping the global temperature rise to 1.5C. Drilling for all this oil and gas in a new development would not even compromise the company’s climate targets, it said. But analysts told Temperature Check the Trion project would lead to the release of about 365m tonnes of CO2-equivalent over its lifetime – equal to about 80% of Australia’s annual emissions. Most of the greenhouse gases from Trion will come when the oil and gas is burned and Woodside has no targets covering those emissions. Instead, the company says it will invest up to US$5bn in “new energy products and low-carbon services” by 2030. But that pledge is dwarfed by the money it is spending on fossil fuel production. Before announcing the US$4.8bn spend on Trion, the company said it planned to spend another US$6bn or so on an oilfield in Senegal and its Scarborough LNG project in Western Australia. Woodside does have targets for the emissions from its own operations (before the fossil fuels are sold and burned) but the company allows itself to buy offsets to meet them, which it did last year to turn a 3.5% rise in emissions into an 11% fall. Woodside thinks Trion will be financially “resilient” in a decarbonising world because it would make a quick return on investment and two-thirds of the fossil fuels would be extracted “within 10 years of start up”. The company said in its announcement it would use the cash from Trion to help fund “future developments in oil, gas and new energy” – a further pointer to the company’s hopes to keep exploiting fossil fuels. Woodside pointed to work done for the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that produces scenarios of how the world will decarbonise. Some of these show there will be a demand for oil in 2030 that is not met by existing fossil fuel projects. But the chief executive of Climate Analytics, Bill Hare, says many of the modelled scenarios with higher levels of fossil fuel use also need “much higher levels of carbon dioxide removal that is likely unachievable and unsustainable”. Hare says Trion would release about 365Mt of CO2-e. A briefing document released by Woodside about the Trion project refers to the International Energy Agency’s scenario for how economies can reach net zero – but that analysis gives no room for new fossil fuel developments. The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, has pointed to a “black and white” contradiction for fossil fuel companies who claim increasing their production is in line with the Paris agreement. Hare tells Temperature Check: “Developing new oil and gas fields is completely inconsistent with getting to 1.5C and requires an almost infinite level of gullibility, wilful or otherwise, from investors and banks to believe and invest in this kind of magical thinking that sets aside as irrelevant or immaterial the increasingly strong analysis and messages from the world’s premier – and legendarily conservative – International Energy Agency.” Climate activists have blockaded ports in Newcastle, Brisbane and Melbourne this week trying to disrupt the coal trade, causing some traffic jams and delays. Sky News Australia host Peta Credlin described it as “export terrorism” and suggested the government should ban the activists from accessing welfare. On Credlin’s show, the former Howard government minister Gary Hardgrave was confused about why protesters would be targeting coal. “Coal is a great renewable resource because the trees suck it out of the sky – that carbon dioxide – every night and turn it back into oxygen,” he said. The protesters should have sat with him in grade 6 where children “would have known how the balance of nature works”. “These people are unhinged. Simple,” Hardgrave said. One might ask why, if trees are sucking all coal’s carbon dioxide out of the sky, the gas continues to accumulate in the atmosphere, adding unfathomable amounts of extra heat to the oceans and driving worsening fire conditions in forests (where magic trees grow).\n",

China is the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and still invests in coal but in recent years it has become the largest investor in domestic renewable energy. The country is now on track to lead international investment in the sector, according to the report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). “As the global transition toward renewables gains pace and as battery storage and electric vehicles technologies pick up momentum, China is setting itself up to dominate these sectors globally over the next several decades of this century,” said IEEFA. IEEFA identified a record high spend of more than US$44bn by China on international takeovers and projects worth more than $1bn – a 38% year-on-year growth. China’s One Belt One Road agenda, which drives infrastructure investment along ancient trade routes, is leading the country’s growth. $8bn of solar equipment has been exported from China since it began, and the country has overtaken the US and Germany to become the number one exporter of environmental goods and services. “China’s presence in wind power globally is also on the rise, led by international activities of companies such as Goldwind and by China Three Gorges’ diversification away from hydroelectricity,” the report said. The trajectory is in stark contrast to that of the US, which last year pulled out of the Paris climate accord and has renewed its support for the coal industry. The decision to abandon the Paris agreement “led to China’s quick reaffirmation of its emissions-reduction pledge”, the report said. “That allows it to further project itself globally as a responsible major power while addressing its domestic air pollution concerns and building world-leading capacity in new energy markets.” As part of its Paris commitments, China pledged to peak its emissions by 2030 while making best efforts to peak earlier. It would also increase the share of renewable or nuclear energy sources to 20%. Co-author of the report and director of IEEFA, Tim Buckley, said China was setting itself up as a global technology leader “whilst the US government looks the other way”. “Although China isn’t necessarily intending to fill the climate leadership void left by the US withdrawal from Paris, it will certainly be very comfortable providing technology leadership and financial capacity so as to dominate fast-growing sectors such as solar energy, electric vehicles and batteries.” The report noted the August 2017 merger of China’s top coal mining company, Shenhua Group Corp, with one of the “big five” power utilities, China Guodian Corp. The newly named China Energy Investment Corp created the world’s largest power generator, and with the clean-energy assets of Guodian, Shenhua’s growth was no longer dependent on the pursuit of coal. “[This] strategic posture [of pursuing coal] has burdened China’s power companies and limited their appetite for innovative new clean energy technologies,” the IEEFA said. The report also found China was “outmanoeuvring other economies” in securing energy commodity supplies such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, allowing them to dominate manufacturing of batteries and electric vehicles. On Monday, the US federal energy regulatory commission rejected a plan by the Donald Trump-led US administration to provide subsidies for coal-fired and nuclear power plants. Last year the energy secretary, Rick Perry, proposed moves to slow the phasing out of the ageing plants and Trump vowed to repeal Obama-era environmental regulations in a bid to end a so-called “war on coal”. However, independent analysis found the subsidies plan would cost taxpayers $10.6bn a year, and the commission on Monday said there was no evidence that retiring coal-fired power plants threatened the reliability of the nation’s electricity grid.\n",

      "Text: Environmental campaigners and clean air groups have warned that the government’s green credentials are in tatters after a flurry of “disastrous decisions” that they say will be condemned by future generations. The government’s plan to expand Heathrow won overwhelming backing in the Commons on Monday – with more than 100 Labour MPs joining the majority of Tory politicians to back the plan – despite grave concerns about its impact on air pollution and the UK’s carbon emissions. On the same day, the government rejected plans for a £1.3bn tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay, dashing industry hopes of Britain leading development of a new source of renewable energy. Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green party said it had been a day “of government-induced environmental disaster”. “First they plough ahead with Heathrow expansion, and now they put a nail in the coffin of the tidal lagoon. They really have taken a wrecking ball to the UK’s climate policies.” The growing concern around the government’s environmental strategy was highlighted by two new developments on Tuesday. Firstly, a coalition of clean air campaigners, green transport groups and environmentalists – including WWF and Greenpeace – has warned that “repeated delays” in the publication of the government’s strategy for sustainable road transport risks undermining the UK’s electric car industry and entrenching dangerous levels of air pollution for decades to come. In a letter to the prime minister, Theresa May, they said reports the government was planning to water down a ban on petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040 would “seriously weaken the UK’s hopes of leading the race towards cleaner transport”. And it urged May to bring forward the 2040 ban on new diesel and petrol car sales by 2030. John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said May’s environment policies were “in tatters” after Heathrow and Swansea and warned further backtracking on its flagship transport strategy would “cement her government’s failure to fulfil its pledge to be a global leader on climate action”. Separately, campaigners have condemned what they say is a watering down of a key element of the government’s climate change strategy, which will mean councils no longer have to assess planning proposals “in line with the objectives and provisions of the Climate Change Act 2008” but will instead only have to have reference to the “context” of the act. Legal advice sought by Friends of the Earth concludes this change “weakens the emphasis to be placed on climate change”. Dave Timms, Friends of the Earth campaigner, said it sent a negative signal to councils about the importance of climate change in the decision-making process. “The devil’s always in the detail, and by weakening the importance of the Climate Change Act in council decision-making, the government is hiding bad news in the fine print.” The government says the new planning proposals are a draft and still being consulted on, and a spokesman rejected claims its environmental policies were in disarray. “Our 25-year environment plan sets out our commitment to leave the environment in a better state than we found it. This includes ambitious plans to replenish depleted soils, rid the seas and oceans of plastic waste, cut greenhouse gas emissions, end the sale of new conventional diesel and petrol cars and vans by 2040, cleanse our air of toxic pollutants and develop cleaner, more sustainable energy sources.” The government’s plans to build a new runway at Heathrow passed through the Commons by 415 votes to 119 – a majority of 296 – on Monday night. It won the backing of the overwhelming number of Tory MPs as well as more than 100 Labour politicians. Environmentalists expressed anger and dismay at what they said was the overwhelming lack of engagement with the scale of the looming climate crisis by most Westminster politicians. A spokesman for the No Heathrow Group, which staged a series of direct action campaigns and organised a hunger strike in opposition to the proposals, said the politicians had failed on the “defining existential issue of our time”. It said a third runway was “a declaration that the lives of those ‘others’ around the world already suffering from the worst impacts of climate change, and the thousands displaced to build the runway, are worth less than the luxuries of the minority of wealthy frequent flyers who stand to benefit most from a third runway.” There is already a legal challenge to the Heathrow plans being prepared by several councils and supported by the mayor of London. Campaigners vowed to continue their fight. A spokesperson for No To Heathrow said: “We are going nowhere, the third runway will never be built, we will use all the disruptive, creative, and peaceful tactics at our disposal to prevent the construction of this extreme and devastating megaproject: Heathrow, expect us.”\n",

      "Text: The Albanese government could have to make decisions on whether to approve up to 28 coalmine developments that would make it harder to meet targets set under its newly approved climate policy, according to a new analysis. A coalmine tracker website published by the Australia Institute includes a breakdown of all projects that have been formally referred to the government for approval under national laws. The group estimated that if all 28 coal projects that have been referred went ahead as proposed, it would add up to 16m tonnes to the country’s annual carbon dioxide emissions. There could be up to another 564m tonnes a year released overseas after the coal was exported and burned in Asia. Combined, they could add nearly 18bn tonnes of emissions if the mines operated for their proposed lifetimes. While it is highly unlikely all 28 proposals will go ahead at full scale, the website stresses that the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, will face decisions on a significant list of fossil fuel projects at odds with warnings from the world’s climate scientists. The biggest projects on the list are in Queensland: the China Stone coalmine (linked to an estimated 4.9bn tonnes of emissions), the Peak Downs coalmine (3.2bn tonnes) and Alpha North coalmine project (3.1bn tonnes). Guardian Australia reported last year that China Stone’s proposal had stalled and it had abandoned its bid for a mining lease in 2019. In addition to the coal projects, there are several proposed gas developments seeking approval under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The future of new coal and gas has been at the heart of negotiations over a planned revamp of a policy known as the safeguard mechanism. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The government rejected the Greens’ call for a ban on new fossil fuels – which was in line with what climate scientists and major international institutions have said is necessary from OECD countries if countries are to meet their promises to avoid an escalating climate crisis. But it agreed to a deal that promises a rolling five-yearly cap on total onsite industrial emissions, expected to start at a level equivalent to about 140m tonnes a year and come down over time, and a requirement that some gas developments spend more than previously agreed on carbon offsets. The Greens argue both steps could prevent some fossil fuel developments from going ahead. The Australia Institute’s research director, Rod Campbell, said the coalmine tracker provided more in-depth information about the coal proposals before the government. He said Plibersek had clear power over whether to approve them. “New coalmines don’t just suddenly appear on the day they are approved,” he said. “These processes take years and involve multiple decisions from different parts of government.” A spokesperson for Plibersek said all relevant projects would be subject to the redesigned safeguard mechanism. According to the agreement between the government and Greens released on Monday, it includes a requirement that the climate change minister would have to assess whether any new project that emitted more than 100,000 tonnes of CO2 a year was consistent with the goal of bringing down industrial emissions under the scheme. “The government’s reforms have been supported across the parliament by the minor parties and independents because they are critical to cutting emissions to put Australia on a path to net zero,” Plibersek’s spokesperson said. Independent senator David Pocock confirmed on Tuesday that he would support the safeguard mechanism changes. He said he welcomed the government including a cap on pollution, which he said gave Australians “certainty that there will be a reduction in emissions under the policy”. But he said he would have preferred a bolder reform that included an economy-wide carbon price and a limit on how many carbon credits some industries could use. “Reforms to the safeguard mechanism are imperfect, but represent a step towards a credible climate policy,” he said. The safeguard changes will require more than 200 industrial facilities, including fossil fuel mines and production sites, to cut emissions intensity by up to 4.9% a year by either paying for onsite cuts or buying carbon offsets. The government expects to pass the legislation this week and for the changes to start on 1 July.\n",

      "Text: Cop28 will be the 28th conference of the parties to the UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC), the parent treaty to the 2015 Paris agreement. It takes place in the United Arab Emirates, a major oil-producing country, against a backdrop of record high temperatures, described by one scientist as “gobsmackingly bananas”; a fresh high for annual greenhouse gas emissions; and rising geopolitical tensions. More than 70,000 people are expected to attend, with the likelihood of a record number of businesses represented – including large numbers of fossil fuel executives. Delegates will be expected to debate a phaseout – or perhaps only a phasedown – of fossil fuels; the future of finance for the most vulnerable countries stricken by climate damage, known as loss and damage; the global stocktake, an assessment of progress under the Paris agreement; how to reduce methane emissions; and help for poor countries to adapt to the impacts of extreme weather. There will also be special days focusing on food and health. The UN framework convention on climate change, signed in 1992 at the Rio Earth summit, binds all of the world’s countries – bar a handful of failed states – to “avoid dangerous climate change”. However, it did not set out in detail how to do so. The first attempt to turn the UNFCCC’s resolution into action was the 1997 Kyoto protocol, which set targets on emissions cuts for each developed country, stipulating a 5% cut in global greenhouse gases overall by 2012. Developing countries, including China, were allowed to increase their emissions. However, the protocol immediately ran into trouble when the US, which signed the treaty under Bill Clinton, could not ratify it owing to opposition in Congress. The protocol eventually came into force without US backing in 2005,  but by then was largely irrelevant, so countries set out on the long journey to a new treaty that would fulfil the UNFCCC aims, resulting in the 2015 Paris accord. Forged at a historic summit in December 2015, this marked the first time developed and developing countries agreed to limit greenhouse gases in order to stay within set temperature limits. The main goal of the Paris agreement is to limit global heating to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels, while “pursuing efforts” to stay within the lower, safer threshold of 1.5C. Countries set out targets to stay within those limits, in the form of nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Nationally determined contributions are national plans containing targets on emissions cuts, usually pegged to 2030, and some details on how they will be met. They form the heart of the Paris agreement. In the negotiations leading up to the Paris summit, countries were reluctant to accept “top-down” targets such as those contained in the Kyoto protocol, which set a global goal for emissions reduction then divided up the cuts needed among the developed countries. Instead, they opted for each government offering the emissions reductions it thought feasible. However, this resulted in a set of NDCs submitted at Paris that would result in catastrophic heating of more than 3C. So the Paris agreement contains a “ratchet” mechanism by which every five years countries must return to the negotiating table with fresh commitments, to bring emissions in line with the overarching temperature targets. At Cop26 in Glasgow, countries agreed to hasten the ratchet, asking for new pledges every year instead of just every five years. The Paris agreement contains two key goals, of limiting global heating to “well below” 2C, while “pursuing efforts” to limit temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. These temperature goals have their roots in reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The 2007 IPCC fourth assessment report suggested the world was likely to warm by at least 1.8C, even if measures were taken to limit emissions, and by 4C if emissions went untrammelled. Keeping warming to about 2C was regarded as the outer limit of safety, beyond which the impacts of climate breakdown – heatwaves, droughts, floods, sea level rises, fiercer storms and other extreme weather – would become catastrophic and irreversible. Some big emitters, including China, argued 2C was the only realistic limit and opting for a lower goal would be economically difficult. However, small island states pointed to science showing they were likely to be inundated by sea-level rises and storm surges at warming above 1.5C. The conflict was eventually resolved in the compromise of two goals at Paris. A further IPCC report in 2018 found extreme weather and severe impacts from even a 1.5C rise, so for Cop26 the UK hosts made “keeping 1.5C alive” the core aim of the conference. This basically means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as far as possible and then offsetting any remaining irreducible emissions – for instance, from industrial processes that emit CO2, or sectors such as aviation where alternative technologies are not available – by fostering carbon sinks, such as forests. The concept has come under attack from campaigners who argue that some companies and governments are using net zero as a fig leaf by assuming they can offset emissions rather than reducing them. One of the most contentious issues at Cop28 will be loss and damage. This refers to the most devastating ravages of extreme weather, so great that no amount of adaptation can help with them. Examples include hurricanes and typhoons, the devastating floods that hit Pakistan in summer 2022, or the droughts afflicting swathes of Africa. Recovery from such devastation can take years, if it is ever achieved, and the infrastructure of developing countries, services such as health and education, and their chances of improving people’s circumstances can suffer permanent damage. The world’s poorest countries, which have done least to cause the climate crisis, are most at risk. In the past, some experts characterised loss and damage as a form of compensation or reparations for poor countries. However, this was unacceptable to developed and large developing countries, which refused to sign legal agreements potentially leaving them liable for unlimited future costs. So the discussion has moved on to loss and damage as a form of rescue and rehabilitation for the countries suffering most, differing from climate finance in that it does not apply to emissions cuts, and addresses broader social and development issues as well as the immediate impacts of extreme weather. Under the Paris agreement, nations are required to measure the progress made towards the emissions cuts needed to ensure the world stays within the temperature limits of the treaty. This five-yearly process is scheduled to begin this year, with the first ever global stocktake, a comprehensive assessment of countries’ progress – or lack of it. The essential parts of the global stocktake have already been published, and they contain little of surprise. The world is far off track to meet the Paris goals, and drastic action is needed urgently in order to cut emissions in line with scientific advice. However, one important element of the global stocktake is that it can be forward-looking – rather than just a look at what has happened, the process will also advise on what needs to be done now. Governments are not scheduled to make the next revisions to their NDCs until 2025, but the global stocktake should inform what those revisions must be. Within the context of the UNFCCC, mitigation means the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The world has already warmed by 1.1-1.2C above pre-industrial levels, and some of the impacts of the current heating are irreversible, so even if we succeed in cutting emissions drastically, we will still need to adapt to the impacts of more extreme weather. Infrastructure, including transport, telecommunications networks, housing and rural areas will need to be adapted and protected, for instance by building railways less likely to buckle in the heat or roads less likely to melt, and building houses that will not overheat. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The body of the world’s leading climate scientists, first convened by the UN and the World Meteorological Organization in 1988, has produced five comprehensive assessment reports since, each increasing in certainty and reinforcing the message that the climate crisis, caused by human actions that increase the levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is accelerating. The latest IPCC report, the sixth, has been published: the first instalment, on the physical science of the changing climate, was released in August 2021, delivering the starkest warning yet of the calamity we face. It found the climate crisis was “unequivocally” the result of human actions, was putting in changes that in some cases were already “irreversible”, and that some of those changes were “unprecedented” in hundreds of thousands of years. The second and third parts, published in 2022, warned that the 1.5C goal was slipping out of reach, and that it was “now or never” for climate action. The IPCC has been criticised for giving too conservative a view of climate science – its key findings, in the “summary for policymakers”, are subject to approval and amendment by governments before publication, which some say means they are unduly weakened. A powerful greenhouse gas, which can trap heat in the atmosphere about 80 times more effectively than CO2. Whereas CO2 lingers in the atmosphere for about a century once released, methane degrades in a couple of decades to carbon CO2. It comes from leaking fossil fuel infrastructure, such as oilwells and shale gas wells, and from animal husbandry and other agriculture. The UAE, hosts of Cop28, are holding a special methane summit on 2 December, to discuss ways of cutting the gas further. Short-lived climate pollutants. These are compounds such as methane, hydrofluorocarbons and soot. They degrade or fall out of the atmosphere more quickly than CO2, but while they are active can play a major role in heating the atmosphere, so actions to reduce them could buy humanity some time in cutting warming sooner. Methane, for instance, traps heat about 80 times more effectively than CO2, and moves to drastically limit it could reduce warming by as much as 0.2C according to some estimates. Soot stains white snow and ice, and the dark surfaces absorb more heat, in a feedback loop. Hydrofluorocarbons are substitutes for the ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons, but they have a high warming potential, with some capable of trapping more than 11,000 times as much heat as CO2. CO2 has the same impact on the climate no matter where it is emitted and what the source, so if a tonne of CO2 can be absorbed from the atmosphere in one part of the world it should cancel out a tonne of the gas emitted in another. So, in theory, companies, governments and individuals can cancel out the impact of some of their emissions by investing in projects that reduce or store carbon – forest preservation and tree planting are among them, but carbon credits are also awarded for projects that reduce fossil fuels in other ways, such as windfarms, solar cookstoves or better farming methods. The practice has been controversial. Developing countries were promised, at the Copenhagen Cop in 2009, that they would receive at least $100bn (£90bn) a year in climate finance from 2020, from public and private sector sources, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the effects of extreme weather. That promise was not met: at Cop26, it was found that about $80bn was provided in 2019. However, new preliminary data from the OECD appears to show the promise was likely to have been met last year, and will almost certainly be met this year. Some developing country activists are unhappy with these estimates, but many poorer developing countries are also unhappy that much of current climate finance flows to middle-income countries, and the poorest receive what share they get mostly in the form of loans that can push them deeper into debt. These issues will be a flashpoint at Cop28, along with the separate but related question of loss and damage.\n",

      "Text: Environmental campaigners have accused the government of trying to bribe the public to accept fracking, after Theresa May unveiled plans to give households cash payments worth thousands of pounds if shale drilling occurs in their areas. The prime minister personally intervened with proposals for households to get direct cash handouts in areas where fracking takes place, changing plans that would have given money to local communities. Announcing the plans on Sunday, No 10 said the cash model would be a “blueprint” for letting people benefit directly from other infrastructure developments as well. It raised the prospect that residents could also get cash handouts if there were housing or office developments in their areas, funded through the community infrastructure levy that is currently under review. The plans to reward people for accepting fracking in their areas provoked immediate criticism from Labour, the Green party and environmental charities. Barry Gardiner, the shadow energy and climate change secretary, particularly criticised the handouts for fracking developments when there was no such “bribe” for people to accept clean-energy wind farms. “Does Theresa May really hold the British public in such high esteem that she thinks they can be bribed into fracking and a fossil fuel future?” he said. “Appealing to people’s higher nature, Theresa May gives a £10,000-plus bribe if you live near a frack site. If you live near a wind farm, nothing … The asymmetry is amazing. Wind farms are subject to a localism veto but for shale gas, [the] government can override.” Public support for fracking hit a new low of 19% in April according to the government’s long-running public attitudes tracker - while the numbers against the energy source had risen to 31%. Support for renewable power in the survey stood at 81%, with only 4% opposing it. Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK chief scientist, said: “The government has tried to sweeten the fracking pill with cash payments before, and it didn’t work. Over the last two years, public opposition has soared and support for shale has tanked. People’s concerns about climate change and their local environment cannot be silenced with a wad of cash. “You can’t put a price on the quality of the air you breathe, the water you drink, and the beauty of our countryside. If Theresa May wants to show the UK is open for business, she should reverse the policies that have harmed our vibrant clean-energy sector and back the technologies that can supply cheap, homegrown energy for decades to come.” The Green party also reacted angrily to the proposal. Molly Scott Cato, a Green party MEP, said: “Theresa May is … offering individual payments, little more than bribes, to households in areas affected by fracking. This is bound to set household against household and can only exacerbate community tensions. “Following hard on the heels of the Hinkley fiasco, this misguided policy to encourage fracking demonstrates again that the government has no strategic energy policy. It is also another worrying indication of the failure of commitment to tackle climate change, first demonstrated by May in her abolition of DECC [the department for energy and climate change]. “The Green party is clear that our energy future must lie with the rapid investment in both energy conservation measures and new renewable capacity. This offers a clean, safe energy future and would also create many thousands of jobs.” It is the latest direct intervention by May over energy policy in the past few weeks. She has abolished Decc by wrapping into a new business and industrial policy brief, and ordered a review of the Hinkley Point nuclear power station, after it had been signed off by EDF, the French state-owned company, and its Chinese co-investors. Plans to compensate residents for fracking were first unveiled under the former chancellor George Osborne last year, who suggested there could be a £1bn shale wealth fund from up to 10% of the tax proceeds of shale drilling to benefit host communities. The new fund could deliver as much as £10m to each community where wells are sited. Downing Street declined to estimate how much payouts could be worth, but it is thought that individual households could receive between £5,000 and £20,000. Speaking ahead of a consultation on the fund, May said she wanted to make sure that individuals benefit personally from economic decisions. “The government I lead will be always be driven by the interests of the many – ordinary families for whom life is harder than many people in politics realise,” the prime minister said. “As I said on my first night as prime minister: when we take the big calls, we’ll think not of the powerful but of you. This announcement is an example of putting those principles into action. It’s about making sure people personally benefit from economic decisions that are taken – not just councils – and putting them back in control over their lives. “We’ll be looking at applying this approach to other government programmes in the future too, as we press on with the work of building a country that works for everyone.” A British Geological Survey study of shale gas across the north of England estimated total reserves of 1,300tn cubic feet – the equivalent of more than 500 years of UK gas consumption at current levels. However, it is still unclear how much of this will be economical to extract and whether it would prove too disruptive to many heavily populated areas.\n",

      "Text: The “terror factor” generated by the new BBC series Earth – which re-creates a climate change event that wiped out most species 250 million years ago – could help “spur us on to do something” about the environment crisis, according to its presenter, Chris Packham. Using the latest scientific discoveries and visual effects, the BBC’s “biography of Earth” shows the parallels between a deadly change in the atmosphere caused by a series of cataclysmic supervolcano eruptions millions of years ago and mankind’s fossil fuel emissions, which Packham explains are “destabilising … with terrifying rapidity” Earth’s protective layer of gases. The series combines the natural history of programmes such as David Attenborough’s Planet Earth with the planetary focus of Brian Cox’s Universe to show how their interconnectivity has created and sometimes almost obliterated life on Earth. Earth started out as a history of the planet. The BBC’s head of science, Tom Coveney, explained: “This wasn’t conceived as a series about climate change, but it felt, as we were making it, that the parallels just jumped out.” Packham said comparisons could be drawn with “the human impact on our planet” and previous climate change events such as the supervolcano eruptions that ripped through the planet’s crust during the pre-dinosaur Permian period, which the programme simulates. The resulting toxic fumes created a mass extinction event. There would almost certainly be another supervolcano eruption one day, Packham said, adding that mankind was choosing to “experiment” with the atmosphere. He asked: “Do we want that on our conscience?” Packham said showing the impact of climate change could scare people, but that this was part of his job: “Fear is a motivating emotion.” But he added: “We’re not terrifying people … just telling them what’s really happening.” Such narratives could be depressing, he said, but “I do think we’ve got the ingenuity – we have the adaptability to survive. [However,] it’s the urgency that makes me despair. “I don’t think enough of those people who are in the decision-making process are feeling it quite enough yet.” Packham said society needed to “look at our global governors and make sure we elect people who are going to make those changes assertively and rapidly”. He said he hoped the series would help by showing how unique Earth is. In a speech he wrote to end the series (which minimised its carbon footprint by filming in as few locations as possible) he argued that the power of humanity could mitigate climate change by “putting Earth first”. He said the Open University and BBC Studios show had many “wow” moments that he hoped people would discuss “over a pint”, including that fungi once covered Earth and that it rained for 2 million years. The naturalist is also exploring, for Channel 4, the topic of environmental activism, which he said he was “concerned … probably isn’t working as optimally as it needs to”. He told the Guardian he had spoken to Greta Thunberg and Attenborough about what they could do next, asking them what happened after their meetings with world leaders: “To paraphrase, they both said, ‘They listened, but then they forgot it the next morning.’” Packham is contemplating blocking some climate deniers who follow him on Twitter and told the Guardian that “we need regulation of social media”, saying: “I fear for young people.” Recently the presenter won a libel case over an online campaign against him which he said highlighted the “oppression and repression that scientists are facing due to social media harassment”. He downplayed comparisons to Attenborough, saying: “David is still very much alive and kicking. I never consider myself as a parallel to him at all. I think we’re very different – he’s brilliant, and I’m not quite so brilliant.” Earth starts on BBC Two and iPlayer on Monday 17 July\n",

      "Text: Frack waste has triggered earthquakes from Ohio to Oklahoma, and fouled rivers in Pennsylvania to North Dakota – and now the Obama administration is being sued by environmental groups to crack down on the industry. A coalition of environmental groups sued the Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday to demand a strong uniform standard for the transportation, storage and disposal of frack waste. Since 1998, when the modern era of fracking began in Texas, the industry has generated hundreds of billions of gallons of frack waste – packed with toxic chemicals such as benzene and naturally occurring substances underground such as radium and arsenic – and there are almost no rules governing the process, environmental groups said. “Updated rules for oil and gas wastes are almost 30 years overdue,” said Adam Kron, senior attorney at the Environmental Integrity Project. With the lawsuit, environmental groups hope to push the EPA to adopt strict national standards for frack water storage and disposal – starting with firm limits on wastewater injection wells. US Geological Survey scientists and independent researchers have found a sharp rise in seismic activity in states such as Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas and connected those tremors to high volumes of frack waste in disposal wells. A single well near Youngstown, Ohio, was linked to 77 earthquakes. Arkansas, Colorado and New Mexico have also experienced a spike in earthquakes, because of high-volume wastewater injection wells. “If the injection of vast gallons of this waste is leading to increased danger of earthquakes, that is certainly reasonable for the EPA to step in and try and do something about it,” Kron said. The suit also hopes to push the EPA to require the industry to install liners on wastewater ponds to prevent spills such as the 2012 breach of a 6m-gallon holding pond in Pennsylvania, which fouled a trout stream, and improve pipeline maintenance. Last year, 3m gallons of drilling waste spilled into a tributary of the Missouri river from a leaky pipe near the town of Williston, North Dakota. The groups were also seeking a ban on the practice of slopping frack waste across roads, as a de-icing agent, or on to fields and stricter controls on dumping waste on landfills. The groups filing the suit include the Environmental Integrity Project, Natural Resources Defense Council, Earthworks, Responsible Drilling Alliance, San Juan Citizens Alliance, West Virginia Surface Owners’ Rights Organization and the Center for Health, Environment and Justice. At the heart of the problem are the vast amounts of wastewater generated by fracking. It can take up to 6m gallons of water, sand and chemicals pumped into the ground at high pressure to flush out oil and gas from the rock formations for a single well. Almost all of that water comes back up again in the form of waste – and there are an estimated 1.7m active oil and gas wells in the US, according to the voluntary disclosure site FracTracker. In 2012, Environment America, which is not involved with the lawsuit, estimated the waste generated by the oil and gas industry in a single year was enough to flood all of Washington DC beneath a 22ft-deep toxic lagoon.\n",

      "Text: Accused of misleading the public for decades on the promise of plastic recycling, oil and chemical companies are pushing a new idea: “advanced recycling”. Environmental advocates, however, say it’s more of the same old greenwash and litigators hope holding companies accountable for past lies might prevent the spread of a new one. In late April, California attorney general Rob Bonta launched an investigation into ExxonMobil for its role in exacerbating the global plastic pollution crisis. Bonta says he was partly inspired by a 2020 investigation from NPR and Frontline that showed how companies like ExxonMobil, Chevron, Dow and Dupont were aware of the inefficacy of plastic recycling, yet they still strategized marketing campaigns that told a different story to the public. For oil companies, those campaigns often included removing themselves from the story altogether. Even some climate advocates forget that plastic, which is made from either petroleum or ethane (a byproduct of fracking), is very much part of the climate crisis. Bonta says his investigation started with ExxonMobil because they’ve been a leader, in the plastics industry and in the messaging around recycling. A report out last year from the Mindaroo Foundation found that just 100 companies produce 90% of the world’s plastic pollution. It pinpointed ExxonMobil as the top producer in the world of single-use plastic. In a statement responding to the investigation, ExxonMobil said it is “focused on solutions” like building the first “commercial-scale advanced recycling technology” and that “meritless allegations like these distract from the important collaborative work that is under way”. But like regular old recycling, “advanced recycling” has so far shown little to no results. Also known as pyrolysis or chemical recycling, the process entails using various chemical processes to turn plastic into other materials. The most common approach is warming plastic at very high heat to turn it into a low-grade fossil fuel, which can then be used either as fuel or as a feedstock for more plastic. The technology is still in its infancy, but early studies have found that like earlier versions of plastic recycling, the “advanced” method is expensive, and that it’s difficult to collect and effectively recycle a wide variety of plastics. It also delivers few environmental benefits, not just because it’s used to create either fuel or more plastic, but also because the process itself is emissions intensive. One study commissioned by plastic manufacturers themselves found that advanced recycling generated more greenhouse gases than either landfilling plastic or burning it. The American Chemistry Council, or ACC, a trade group for the chemical industry, has been pushing advanced recycling since China shut its borders to used plastic in 2018. The group has also been lobbying state governments to exempt their recycling process from various environmental regulations – 18 states have laws on the books that either side-step certain government oversight or designate advanced recycling facilities as eligible for subsidies. It’s part of a strategy former Exxon lobbyist Keith McCoy called “getting ahead of government intervention” in a video interview with the Greenpeace-funded investigative journalism site UnEarthed in 2021. The journalists went undercover as corporate recruiters and got McCoy talking about various lobbying strategies on climate change. “The issue is going to be disposal and recycling of plastics,” McCoy said in previously unpublished portions of the interview that were shared with the Guardian. He also noted that the ACC has been working on this issue “almost exclusively, because [federal regulators] are talking about banning plastics and a lot of it has to do with plastics in the ocean and in waterways”. A new report out this week from the groups Beyond Plastics and The Last Beach Cleanup found that plastic recycling rates have actually fallen in the US since the emergence of “advanced recycling” in 2018, from its highest ever point of 9% to less than 6% today, compared with a 66% recycling rate for paper. “They’re finally kind of admitting that recycling hasn’t worked,” Beyond Plastics president Judith Enck said of groups like ACC and its members that have been lobbying against environmental protections. “And it doesn’t work by design. It’s not like they’re surprised by this. They knew all along it wouldn’t work.” And the plastic pollution crisis isn’t likely to let up. As Bonta noted in his investigation, the fossil fuel industry has spurred the expansion of plastic for years to come. “It’s their plan B as we reduce the use of fossil fuels in transportation and buildings,” he said. The International Energy Agency has said this as well, predicting that plastic production, which is forecasted to double by 2040, will be the biggest growth market for the oil industry over the next decade. McCoy noted that oil companies like his former employer ExxonMobil were uniquely suited to handle the increased scrutiny on plastics because they could use the same strategy they have deployed on climate change. “You want to get smart on it, because you know it’s coming,” he said. Environmental sociologist Dr Rebecca Altman, author of the forthcoming book An Intimate History of Plastics, points to the history of Exxon’s forefather, Standard Oil, as one of the four original companies that created the modern petrochemical industry. Mobil Oil also introduced the plastic grocery bag to American stores. “They really commercialized that and took on the paper bag, which was sort of the last bastion of paper in the US supermarket by the 1970s,” Altman said. That meant Mobil was also entrenched in the various PR battles that the chemical and energy industries were dealing with in the 1970s. “The [petrochemical] industry was really trying to figure out: how do we show our positive value? And the answer was positive advertising and then working behind the scenes on energy policy and dealing with the first wave of environmental legislation,” Altman said. “And then in the 1980s and 1990s you have this big recycling boom.” Bonta says he’d love to see advanced recycling work, but right now it’s just “words on paper”. A 2021 Reuters investigation found several examples of failed advanced recycling programs, noting that out of 30 projects operating around the world, all were either still operating on a modest scale or had shut down, and more than half were years behind schedule on previously announced commercial plans. A report from the Natural Resources Defense Council published in March noted that even when it “works” advanced recycling is not an environmentally friendly solution. Bonta says his investigation will include not only what the industry said about recycling in the past, but also the way it is marketing advanced recycling today. The inquiry may very well broaden to include other companies, or trade groups like the ACC. “We’ll go where the documents lead us,” he said. As to whether the investigation might become a lawsuit, Bonta says that is “absolutely” a possibility. “We’re not investigating just to investigate,” he said.\n",

      "Text: I recently stood on a walkway high above the enormous Dutch flower auction at Aalsmeer, watching a sea of blooms in motion below me. Twenty million flowers a day move through these giant auction houses, coming into the Netherlands from places such as Kenya, Ecuador, Thailand and China, and then getting shipped to flower shops in London, New York and Paris. Here were thousands of truckloads of festivity, well wishes, love, apologies and even regrets. It's a vast global trade built on the flower's mysterious ability to communicate affection and sentiment. This is especially true on Mother's Day, when an estimated 7m bunches of flowers go to British mothers, bringing the flower industry £225m in sales. But isn't it wasteful to grow a flower on the equator, truck it to the airport, fly it halfway around the world, and put it back on a truck or a train, just to feed our frivolous fascination with sweetheart roses or Thai orchids? Isn't it greedy and shortsighted to insist upon the year-round availability of fresh flowers at ridiculously cheap prices? The decision to bring your mother a bouquet this Sunday certainly carries global implications. A third of the UK's flower imports come from Kenya, where workers earn an average of £45 per month. As I travelled the world visiting flower farms, it became clear to me that the woman picking roses in Colombia or Kenya was somebody's mother, too. She works long hours for wages that don't offer a path out of poverty, risks exposure to harmful chemicals, and worries about her children's education. What price does she pay for my Mother's Day gift? Maude Barlow, senior adviser on water to the president of the UN General Assembly, argues that the environmental costs are also unforgivably high. Polluted runoff and depletion of water levels at Kenya's Lake Naivasha, where more than 30 flower farms are located, are problems that we must take responsibility for. The lake stretches across 53 square miles and is fed only by underground springs; it is an important source of drinking water for local villagers and a habitat for hundreds of species of birds and other wildlife. \"The water levels are down about 25%,\" she says, \"and the hippopotamuses - the largest wild tribe left in east Africa - are dying. They're baking in the sun. The lake can't sustain this any longer.\" And it isn't just Lake Naivasha. \"Every single big lake in Africa is in crisis,\" she says. \"Europe does wonderful work preserving its own water, but the way it's doing that is to use other people's water.\" Add the water footprint to the carbon footprint, factor in the implications of chemical use on the farms and poor working conditions for workers, and it's a wonder the flowers don't wilt under the weight of all this worry. But here's the catch: we rarely ask these questions about the keyboards we type on, the chairs we sit on, or the heater that keeps us warm. Imported flowers are an easy target, ephemeral and unnecessary. Refusing to buy them may offer us a fleeting satisfaction, but it doesn't deliver any long-term solutions. And while you try to sort through your ethical dilemma, your long-suffering mother awaits her bouquet. There is another option, which was made clear to me when I followed Heather Gorringe through a flower field in Herefordshire. Her company, Wiggly Wigglers, ships upwards of 650 bouquets a day around Mother's Day. These are natural, unfussy bouquets packed with whatever happens to be in bloom that day. They celebrate the English countryside and support small farms. The worst complaint she has ever had about her bouquets came from someone who said that the flowers were too much like those she already grew in her own garden. But, as Gorringe points out, most people don't have those kinds of gardens any more. \"Most people tell us that the flowers remind them of the garden that their mother or their grandmother had,\" she says. Jane Lindsey, the young and extraordinarily enthusiastic proprietor of Snapdragon Garden Flowers near Drymen, in central Scotland, ships potted bulbs such as exotic snakeshead fritillaries for her Mother's Day customers. She wishes the day fell later in the spring, when her fields are full of flowers, but since she can't change the date, she hopes to change people's expectations by convincing them to shop seasonally and choose early spring bulbs over hothouse roses. And I'm encouraged by the efforts of people such as Rosebie Morton at The Real Flower Company, who grows old-fashioned fragrant English garden roses in season, and has a partnership with a sustainable flower farm in the Nanyuki region of Kenya, far away from Lake Navaisha, to round out the year's offerings. By locating the farm in an area that receives adequate rainfall, irrigation water simply has to be captured and stored. By bringing better water storage solutions to the area, water quality there has improved  for the entire community. The farm supports local schools with donations, and offers decent jobs to nearly 500 people. Surely these farms are worth supporting. In spite of everything I've seen, my mother still gets a bouquet on Mother's Day. It takes a bit more effort, but every year I manage to find flowers that were raised as carefully as she raised me, and that pleases both of us.

      "Text: Greta Thunberg, the young Swedish climate activist, has tapped into a global passion for change from the outdated, exploitative system to a holistic and responsible one (Thunberg tells US Congress: ‘I want you to take real action on climate’, 19 September). The industrial paradigm separates materials from their histories. Forests may have been torn down, lakes polluted, people and animals displaced, but the consumer doesn’t know this. Society has taught us that it is essential to have the latest product and not to question where it came from or who was hurt in the process. The need for change has to be now. Sometimes it is hard to know what to do. People have been led by consumerism for so long that it is difficult to see that there is another way, but there are many practical things we can do, such as: don’t fly unless absolutely necessary; eat less meat and dairy; plant a tree; create a garden with shrubs and flowers that will attract wildlife; line-dry clothes; unplug electronic devices; turn lights off when not needed; drive less; grow your own vegetables or eat local produce; don’t buy fast fashion; ask where products have come from. Some of these will inevitably lead to a change in lifestyle, but if we do nothing our precious planet is at risk. We need to care for this planet like it is our own skin. It is time to look upwards into the sky and realise that there is nowhere else for us to go and to value this beautiful place we call home.Diana SandersLlanfihangel Glyn Myfyr, Conwy  On 20 September, many people will strike to raise awareness of the climate crisis and encourage governments to take action to tackle it. While this is a worthwhile endeavour, there’s no need to wait for a special date to commit to saving the planet. If you truly want to combat climate change, you can start today by removing meat, eggs and dairy from your shopping list. Each year, humans kill 60 billion land animals for food – that’s almost 7 million every hour. All these animals produce massive amounts of waste, which releases powerful greenhouse gases into our atmosphere. Animal agriculture is the single largest source of both methane and nitrous oxide, greenhouse gases that are, respectively, 25 and 300 times more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. A person who follows a vegan lifestyle produces the equivalent of 50% less carbon dioxide than a meat-eater and uses 1/11th of the oil, 1/13th of the water, and 1/18th of the land. That’s why the United Nations has stated that a global shift towards a vegan diet is essential to combat the worst effects of climate change, and research from the University of Oxford has found that going vegan is “the single biggest way” to reduce our environmental impact. So by all means take part in the strike for the climate – but remember that change starts on your plate and choose planet- and animal-friendly vegan meals.Sascha CamilliPeta Foundation  We cannot forget the rural poor in Africa as we tackle the climate crisis. Your recent article covering the Bloem report (Fighting climate crisis by avoiding meat ignores poor countries’ needs – report, 17 September) has confirmed what we have known for a long time: we need country- and community-specific solutions to address global nutrition and the climate crisis. Meeting sustainable diets in rural Africa remains a challenge. With livestock traditionally playing a significant part, the crucial question is of how animals are managed going forwards. In holistic, integrated farm systems, livestock can play a part in sequestering carbon, as well as ensuring that children grow up free from the lifelong effects of stunting due to malnutrition. With this in mind, the addition of livestock to small-holder farms in rural Africa cannot be tossed aside; it is still the sustainable solution they so desperately need. A dairy cow can, for example, regenerate tired soil through manure, and provide essential nutrition from milk. Without access to processed protein alternatives like tofu, eggs and milk are the most effective way for rural African communities to prevent stunting in children. The difference between the industrial-scale cattle ranching that is destroying the Amazon and sustainable family farmers in Africa really cannot be stressed enough.Richie AlfordDirector of research and impact at the charity Send a Cow  There are many of us who would agree with George Monbiot’s heartfelt plea to prevent wealth due to its irrevocable destruction of the planet (For the sake of life on Earth, we must put a limit on wealth, 19 September). It seems screamingly obvious to me too. But how do we bring about the change required to achieve this. No wealthy person is going to voluntarily give up reaping the rewards of wealth earned by their hard work. Their wealth is stashed away in financial havens all round the world. Have we got to recognise that the capitalist system is flawed? As a child playing Monopoly, it was clear that once the expensive properties had been acquired by one player the game was over. In real life the same rule applies: only other rich people can play a rich person’s game. So, George, let us hear your suggestions of how we can stop people getting rich; how the capitalist system can be revised to share wealth more equally? How can we change the human mindset? The human race is very competitive and individualistic. That is why we are still here today. But if we do not find a way, I believe we could destroy ourselves and the planet. I see it as evolution turned on its head. We have to go in reverse. Angela FinchSydenham, London  The effects of the climate emergency are blindingly obvious. All around us, we can see the damage in gardens, allotments, parks and farms in south-east and eastern areas of England. Due to the record high temperatures and very low rainfall, many trees are in danger, vegetables and shrubs are collapsing or failing to flourish, and grass is turning brown. And the air quality is even worse than usual in many areas as a result, with consequent risks to health. But you would be hard put to gather any of this from watching or listening to weather bulletins on mainstream TV and radio. Over and over again, weather presenters cheerfully welcome the high temperatures and dryness with barely a mention of the damage being caused. Any chance of rain is usually described as a risk, rather than something desperately needed. How do weather presenters think that plants, trees and wildlife grow and flourish? It is especially worrying that the effects of the climate emergency are being normalised on mainstream TV and radio. The BBC and other broadcasters need to step up to the plate and properly inform and educate people about the effects of the climate emergency on our weather. Programmes about extreme weather or climate change don’t redress the balance when everyday weather bulletins normalise what is happening and ignore the extremely serious effects.Linda LennardSt Albans, Hertfordshire  Bill McKibben is so right (If the world ran on sun, it wouldn’t fight over oil, 18 September). A few years ago I wrote to the then Tory energy secretary suggesting that every new-build house be fitted with solar panels. The reply I received was that the cost to housebuyers would be excessive in an already inflated housing market. Yet an extra £7,000 on the mortgage for a £400,000 house is peanuts and would soon be recouped by energy cost savings. It would revitalise the solar industry, guarantee work in that sector for evermore, and help save our planet. Everyone I share this idea with supports it as being sensible and an easy part solution to the oncoming climate crisis – particularly if we continue to get such global warming and sunshine as we have seen these last couple of years. I cannot for the life of me think what objections governments can have to this in this day and age. I wish someone in authority would tell me.Rob Parrish,Starcross, Devon   Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com  Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters  Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

      "Text: Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt wants to hold televised ‘Red Team/Blue Team’ climate science ‘debates.’ The idea is that a ‘Red Team’ of scientists will challenge the mainstream findings of ‘Blue Team’ scientists. That may sound familiar, because it’s exactly how the peer-review process works. But climate deniers have lost the debate in the peer-reviewed literature, with over 97% of peer-reviewed studies endorsing the consensus on human-caused global warming, and the few contrarian papers being flawed and failing to withstand scientific scrutiny.  So Scott Pruitt is trying to put his thumb on the scale, giving the less than 3% of contrarian scientists equal footing on a ‘Red Team.’ John Oliver showed how to do a statistically representative televised climate debate (so brilliantly that it’s been viewed 7.4m times), but it’s probably not what Pruitt had in mind: Climate ‘Red Teams’ are a concept that the fossil fuel-funded Heritage Foundation tried four years ago, calling its 2013 ‘NIPCC report’ part of the group’s “Red Team mission.” But much like climate contrarian research papers, the NIPCC report was riddled with errors and long-debunked myths. The name also evokes images of the red and blue pills in The Matrix, in which characters could choose to remain in the Matrix (denial) by taking the blue pill, or accept reality with the red pill. In this case the colors are reversed, but the concept is the same – by choosing the red team, Pruitt and company are choosing the soothing comfort of denial over the harsh reality of human-caused climate change and the threats it poses. Fortunately, it seems like a growing number of Republican leaders are choosing the red pill. In April, Trump’s energy secretary Rick Perry ordered a 60-day study of the nation’s electric grid to determine whether policies promoting renewable energy growth are undermining its stability by crowding out “baseload” power from sources that are always readily available (ie don’t rely on intermittent wind or sunlight). Perry’s memo specifically called out “regulatory burdens introduced by previous administrations that were designed to decrease coal-fired power generation.” He put Travis Fisher in charge of the study, who previously worked for the fossil fuel-funded Institute for Energy Research, where he published a report calling renewable energy policies “the single greatest emerging threat” to the US power grid. In short, it appeared as though the Trump administration was putting together a biased report to support its pro-coal agenda. But a draft of the report was leaked to Bloomberg, and it didn’t follow the administration playbook. The report was drafted by career staffers at the Department of Energy, who are experts in the field and apparently didn’t bow to any potential administration pressure for pro-fossil fuel conclusions. The draft is now under review by administration officials and may change as a result, but the leaked draft ensures that the public sees the experts’ conclusions. The report concluded that many recent baseload plant retirements “are consistent with observed market forces,” often being taken out of commission due to “low natural gas price-based electricity prices, low electric demand, environmental regulations, state policies, and competition from renewables”. Most of the coal and natural gas baseload plants that have retired are old, inefficient units that were no longer cost-effective. Increased energy efficiency has also curbed American electricity demand. The report concluded that environmental regulations and renewable energy subsidies “played minor roles” in accelerating baseload plant retirements compared to those other factors. Most importantly, the draft report concluded that the electric grid remains reliable: These conclusions are consistent with the opinions of grid operators – including in red states where wind supplies a significant fraction of electricity (including Perry’s home state of Texas) – that renewables are not undermining grid stability. They’re also consistent with a major Department of Energy-funded two-year study published in 2012, which concluded: It’s unclear why Perry thought his 60-day study would overturn the findings of that two-year report, or many other similar studies. Even some Republicans from states that benefit from cheap wind energy were critical of the report. For example, Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) wrote to Perry: In another positive sign that Republican climate denial is cracking, an amendment to cut Department of Defense (DoD) funding for a study on how climate change will impact national security over the next 20 years was defeated by a vote of 185-234, including 46 Republicans (led by 22 of the 24 Republican members of the Climate Solutions Caucus) voting against the amendment. The US military has long recognized the national security threats posed by climate change. Normally the GOP views itself as the more pro-military party, but on climate change they’ve resisted the DoD’s findings. While three-quarters of House Republicans voted in favor of the amendment, a significant fraction bucked the climate denial establishment, in this case opting to take the red pill. It may seem like a minor event, but any cracks in the wall of GOP climate denial represent important progress. Perhaps the party needs its own version of Neo to accelerate the process.\n",

      "Text: The governments that assume power after elections around the world this year will be held to the same climate obligations as their predecessors, the chief of this year’s UN climate summit has warned. Cop29 will be held in Azerbaijan in November, near the end of a crucial year in which most of the global population – from the UK, the EU and the US to India and Russia – will head to the polls. The US presidential election, likely to be a bitter fight with climate a key issue, will be held on 5 November, with Cop29 to take place days later, from 11 to 22 November, in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku. Even if new administrations are formed, they will face the same need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and tackle global heating, the incoming president of Cop29, Mukhtar Babayev, has said. “I don’t think that any election will change the policy of any countries to move forward the consolidation of these issues [on the climate],” Babayev told the Guardian in his first big interview since his appointment in January. “That’s why our target is to use any chance, any communication, with these countries to move this process to positive results and positive outcomes.” Incoming governments of whatever stripe would still have to cope with the reality of the climate crisis, he said, and the Azerbaijan presidency would hold them to their committments . “I think all countries will follow their obligations, and we will move to this direction,” he said. “I’m optimistic. We will do everything and will do our best to [ensure] all countries move in this direction.” Noting that elections were taking place in many countries, Babayev declined to single out any specific states but acknowledged that the US election was “a very interesting process”. He said: “Until the end of this year, we will work with the current administration. And I think we have a very good chance, to invite all the participants to Baku to discuss the agenda. We’re working with the current administration of the US to at least develop the agenda to work together, to achieve the targets together.” Azerbaijan has been an oil producer since the 1840s, and is one of the world’s top fossil fuel suppliers. Oil and gas account for 92% of the country’s exports, according to US data, and about two-thirds of the state budget, and the country is planning to increase its gas output by a third in the next decade. Babayev said the government was moving to decarbonise the economy, boosting renewable energy and seeking a transition away from fossil fuels. Oil production was expected to reduce, he said, but gas production would need to increase to meet demands from the EU, which since the invasion of Ukraine had sought to find gas supplies to replace those it used to get from Russia. “We have to deliver [gas] to the European market, because of a big request from the EU. We have already adopted a programme to deliver more gas. But the programme is to invest all these revenues, or at least to consider how it’s possible to invest these revenues, to transform the economy in a green direction,” he said. He also highlighted the country’s efforts to decarbonise, with a target of moving from 98% fossil fuels in its energy mix to 30% renewables by 2030. “Azerbaijan is the leader in the region to invest in alternative energy. [It is] the intention of Azerbaijan to turn the corner on our economy to green directions. Already, a lot of programmes have been adopted by our government, [in pursuit of this green growth agenda],” Babayev said. Among these, Azerbaijan is exploring offshore wind in the Caspian Sea, and is working on plans to export green energy under the Black Sea to Hungary and Romania. Holding a Cop summit in such a fossil fuel dependent country is controversial, and Azerbaijan was a late choice to host. At Cop28, where the decision was taken, Russia vetoed potential offers from eastern European states to host, but decided not to stand in the way of Azerbaijan’s eventual offer. Babayev, who has also written an opinion piece for the Guardian, pointed to the support of Armenia, with which Azerbajian has been in conflict over disputed territory since before the collapse of the Soviet Union until the surrender of the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh after a military offensive by Azerbaijan last September. “Azerbaijan can play the role of bridge between [the global] north and south, and between the east and west,” he pledged. This would be assisted, he added, by the formal adoption of a “troika” system by the UN, by which the previous hosts – United Arab Emirates, which hosted Cop28 in Dubai last December, and still holds the presidency of the talks until the start of Cop29 – and the hosts of Cop30, Brazil, will coordinate their work on the negotiations. At Cop29, one of the key issues is likely to be climate finance, as poor countries struggle to find the funding they need to invest in clean energy and move away from fossil fuels. Babayev called on the private sector to step up with funding for a green transition in the developing world, as well as publicly funded banks such as the World Bank. “Our task is to invite as much as possible the private sector for climate finance – it’s a very good source for new initiatives, new formats, new mechanisms for finance,” he said. Cop29 will take place at the end of what is likely to be another year of record-breaking temperatures around the world. Last month marked the first time average global temperatures for a whole year had exceeded the vital scientific threshold of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. One year of such heights is not enough to invalidate the Paris agreement, under which countries aspire to hold temperatures within the 1.5C limit, but scientists are increasingly pessimistic, as global emissions have not yet started to fall as they need to, and rapidly. Babayev insisted the 1.5C goal must still be the central focus of the UN framework convention on climate change talks. “We need to consolidate our efforts to 1.5C,” he said. “I’m not pessimistic on this issue. We have to move on the target and the implementation of the programme [to reduce global emissions]. If we start the action, start the implementation of the agreements made at previous Cops, we have a chance. We will do our best.”\n",

      "Text: Africa is poised to lead the world’s cleanest economic revolution by using renewable energy sources to power a massive spread of urbanisation, says an IEA report. The IEA, or International Energy Agency, predicts that solar energy will play a big role in supporting the continent’s growing population and industrialisation over the next 20 years. Africa has less than half the solar power installations seen in the UK, despite the sunnier conditions, but the IEA is predicting a solar boom in countries across the continent, which could give hundreds of millions of homes electricity for the first time. The report forecasts that Africa’s appetite for energy will grow at double the rate of the global average in the coming decades as the continent overtakes China and India as the most populated region in the world. Africa’s population is expected to grow to more than 2 billion people by 2040, a rise of 800 million from today or the population equivalent of the US and Europe combined, says the report. People are expected to turn to cities and towns at a rate never seen before, where the demand for new houses and infrastructure will ignite an energy-hungry industrial revolution. Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, said Africa had a “unique opportunity” to leapfrog the fossil fuel dependency of other industrialised regions and host the first economic transformation that did not contribute to the climate crisis. “I am optimistic about Africa’s energy future – it will surprise pessimists,” Birol said. “I have great expectations for the energy industry in the years to come, both in terms of bringing energy access to Africa’s people but also driving economic growth.” He urged Africa’s leaders to take advantage of the natural resources available through solar power generation, and the mining of raw minerals needed to make electric and hydrogen batteries, which are in high demand across the world. He said some fossil fuels, such as natural gas, would be needed to support Africa’s heavy industries as they built the towns and cities needed to house the continent’s growing population. But the increase would be insignificant in the wider global climate effort, according to the IEA. Birol said: “Africa’s total contribution to cumulative global emissions from energy over the last 100 years is only 2%, which is half the emissions of Germany today. If everyone in Africa had access to energy this 2% will rise to just 3% – it’s still nothing. It’s peanuts compared to other countries in the world which are using fossil fuels such as coal for energy. “But while Africa does not contribute to climate change the continent is on the frontline of its potential effects, including droughts. Africa is perhaps the most innocent continent in terms of its contributions to climate change, but they will be the victims.”\n",

      "Text: Fossil fuels benefited from record subsidies of $13m (£10.3m) a minute in 2022, according to the International Monetary Fund, despite being the primary cause of the climate crisis. The IMF analysis found the total subsidies for oil, gas and coal in 2022 were $7tn (£5.5tn). That is equivalent to 7% of global GDP and almost double what the world spends on education. Countries have pledged to phase out subsidies for years to ensure the price of fossil fuels reflects their true environmental costs, but have achieved little to date. Explicit subsidies, which cut the price of fuels for consumers, doubled in 2022 as countries responded to the higher energy prices resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine. Rich households benefited far more from these than poor ones, the IMF said. Implicit subsidies, which represent the “enormous” costs of the damage caused by fossil fuels through climate change and air pollution, made up 80% of the total. Ending the subsidies should be the centrepiece of climate action, the IMF said, and would put the world on track to restrict global heating to below 2C, as well as preventing 1.6 million air pollution deaths a year and increasing government revenues by trillions of dollars. The researchers acknowledged that subsidy reform was politically difficult, but said carefully designed policies that supported poorer households could work, especially if coordinated internationally. The IMF’s findings come as the climate crisis wreaks havoc across the world, from heatwaves, wildfires and floods from the Americas to Europe to Asia. Cutting fossil fuel subsidies “needs to be the centrepiece of efforts over the next few years to get on track with limiting global warming to below 2C”, said Ian Parry of the IMF. “Ideally this is done through carbon pricing [and] some of the revenues from reforms should be used to compensate poor and vulnerable households. “We are in this situation because it can be very difficult to increase taxes on fossil fuels, not least when countries are acting unilaterally,” he said. “We recommend that large emitting countries coordinate on carbon pricing or similar policies to help scale up global action.” Ipek Gençsü, a subsidies expert at the ODI thinktank, said: “The IMF report shows that, at a time when the world is starting to experience worsening impacts of climate change, governments continue to pour fuel on to the fire by providing record levels of subsidies for fossil fuels. “If we are to have any chance of avoiding irreversible and tragic consequences of climate change, governments simply have to show bolder leadership, by phasing out their support for production and consumption of fossil fuels.” The G20 nations, which cause 80% of global carbon emissions, pledged to phase out “inefficient” fossil fuel subsidies in 2009. However, the G20 poured a record $1.4tn (£1.1tn) into fossil fuel subsidies in 2022, according an estimate by the International Institute for Sustainable Development thinktank. The World Bank reported in June that fossil fuel and agricultural subsidies combined could amount to $12tn (£9.5tn) a year and were causing “environmental havoc”. Canada recently announced plans to end some fossil fuel subsidies. Nigeria, which had been spending four times more on petrol subsidies than on healthcare, removed them in May. However, past subsidy removals often have been reversed after protests. The IMF analysis found petrol and other oil products accounted for half of explicit subsidies in 2022, with coal accounting for 30% and fossil gas 20%. The biggest subsidisers of fossil fuels were China, the US, Russia, the EU and India. Coal was particularly heavily subsidised, with 80% of it sold at less than half its true cost. The researchers said the estimate of the total fossil fuel subsidies in 2022 would have been much higher – about $12tn – if they had used higher climate damage costs that were recently published. The analysis calculated that ending fossil fuel subsidies would cut emissions by 34% by 2030 compared with 2019 levels, representing a large chunk of the 43% cut needed to have a good chance of keeping global heating below 1.5C. The researchers said that for subsidy reform policies to avoid political backlash and be successful they needed to be phased in gradually, provide financial support to those on low incomes and use the increased revenues productively. The World Bank report said: “Although [cutting subsidies] will entail demanding policy reforms, the costs of inaction will be far higher.”\n",

      "Text: More than 10,000 workers are battling against time to remove a thick algal bloom that has carpeted the Olympic sailing venue in Qingdao in east China, officials said. Qingdao Olympic Sailing Committee officials warned that it would take two weeks to clear the growth, which competitors - including members of the British sailing team - say is hampering training in the run-up to the games. It has blocked practice routes and covered almost one-third of the competition area. A total 5,000 square miles (13,000 square kilometres) is affected, the state news agency Xinhua reported. A thousand fishing boats have been dredging the area and already 100,000 tonnes of lurid, blue-green algae have been removed. Organisers are also trying to prevent more from spreading into clear waters. Officials told a news conference yesterday that they expected to complete the clean-up by July 15 (visit our gallery featuring the clean-up of  algae at the Olympic sailing venue, Qingdao). But although the Olympics do not begin until August, many international competitors are already training in Qingdao, 400 miles south-east of Beijing. \"Some of our guys are out there at the moment and it has been an issue. You can't sail through this stuff; it's pretty thick,\" said Lindsey Bell, communications manager for the British Olympic team. \"The authorities are doing their best and there are plenty of boats out there to clear it all away; it's just a bit of a race against time to see if they can shift it all before the competition starts.\" The algae was first spotted at the end of May and has spread rapidly, smothering beaches and extending well out into the water. Algal blooms have become an increasingly frequent problem on China's inland lakes because of pollution from industry and farm chemicals. While the growth in Qingdao is not thought to present a health risk, some blooms produce dangerous toxins which can cause illness and occasionally death if it contaminates seafood. Wang Shulian, vice director of Qingdao's Ocean and Fishing Bureau, yesterday told reporters the outbreak had no \"substantial link\" to environmental conditions or water quality. \"The algae is of various sorts, which will prosper under [the right] temperature and salinity of sea water,\" he said. Yuan Zhiping, an official with the Qingdao Olympic Sailing Committee, added: \"We have stressed … that the priority should be given to the Olympic venue.\" With the games only weeks away, officials are stepping up preparations. They announced this weekend that all Olympic venues are open and have been tightening security across Beijing.\n",

      "Text: The recent frenzy following the events in Japan suggests that the media are keen to feed our nuclear fears, by focusing on exposure to radiation that is extremely unlikely to result in a single death, compared with a natural catastrophe that has killed at least 20,000 people and displaced more than 100,000. We are a successful species inhabiting a radioactive world and must have evolved protective mechanisms to deal with the effects of natural radiation. Let's inject some science into the nuclear debate to find out just how dangerous exposure to radiation might be, and apply it to our daily lives. What can our experience of the atomic bombs and Chernobyl tell us about the health effects of radiation exposure? Radiation can be divided into two main types – highly penetrating such as X and gamma ray, and isotopic such as iodine-131, which needs to enter the body to have an effect. The radiation exposure in Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a short-lived, intense, exposure to relatively high doses of penetrating radiation. Following the Chernobyl accident, the radiation was prolonged and mainly isotopic. Exposure was therefore via ingestion and inhalation of radiostopes, mainly iodine-131 and caesium-137. The majority of those who died following the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki died from flash burns or other injuries; 15-20% died as a result of acute radiation sickness. Long-term studies between 1950 and 1997 show that, of the 9,335 cancer deaths in the 86,572 population, only 440 (5%) of the solid cancers and 103 of 310 leukaemias were attributed to radiation exposure. A very small proportion (0.8%) of non-cancer related deaths were also associated with radiation. In addition, there are no inherited effects observed in the subsequent generation. The decrease in average life expectancy is 2.6 years and 21 days respectively for those who received the highest and lowest doses. Since the majority of the population received low doses, the average loss of life expectancy is four months. The argument can be made that the full consequences will only be known when the last of the exposed generation have reached old age, but we can already ask the question, \"does radiation exposure at this level, cause as many health problems as we thought?\" I do not think so. The only proven radiobiological effect has been an increase in thyroid cancer in those who were young at the time of the accident. The increase was rapid, and is still apparent today, although the level of thyroid cancer is back to what it was prior to the accident for those who were born from 1987 onwards – when the radioactive iodine disappeared from the environment. There appears to be little difference in the type or clinical outcome of radiation-induced thyroid cancer when compared with age-matched controls. Thyroid cancer is very amenable to treatment and although 30% of patients may suffer a relapse, only 1% may eventually die of their disease. Of 6,000 diagnosed cases since 1986, only 15 have so far proved fatal. Many of these cases would have been prevented if potassium iodide had been provided at the appropriate time. There is still no evidence for increases in other diseases in the exposed population at large And in the exclusion zone around the reactor (now a thriving natural environment), the presence of higher-than-background levels of caesium-137 suggests it poses little risk to human or animal health. Life-span studies, similar to those carried out in Japan, would be needed in order to identify any further minor health effects. So what have we learnt from Chernobyl? Cancer risk is determined by the age at exposure and concentration of radioisotopes in particular tissues. Low dose exposure to caesium-137, even over a long period of time, is perhaps not as damaging to health as we would have predicted. The one thing we appear not to have learnt is how to deliver information about radiation risk to an exposed population. There have been considerable psychological consequences, unrelated to the actual radiation risks for human health, from the Chernobyl accident, which have been poorly researched. Radiation risk must be put into context. The consequences for the most exposed group of atomic bomb survivors was an average loss of life expectancy significantly lower than that caused by severe obesity or smoking. A rational debate about nuclear power means putting the risks and benefits into perspective. Unfortunately it seems that when radiation knocks at the door, science and rational thinking go out of the window.

      "Text: Ocean waters are rising because of global warming. They are rising for two reasons. First, and perhaps most obvious, ice is melting. There is a tremendous amount of ice locked away in Greenland, Antarctica, and in glaciers. As the world warms, that ice melts and the liquid water flows to the oceans. The other reason why water is rising is that warmer water is less dense – it expands. This expansion causes the surface of the water to rise. Rising oceans are a big deal. About 150 million people live within 1 meter (3 feet) of sea level. About 600 million live within 10 meters (33 feet) of sea level. As waters rise, these people will have to go somewhere. It is inevitable that climate refugees will have to move their homes and workplaces because of rising waters.  In some places, humans will be able to build sea walls to block off the water’s rise. But, in many places, that won’t be possible. For instance, Miami, Florida has a porous base rock that allows sea water to permeate through the soils. You cannot wall that off. In other places, any sea walls would be prohibitively expensive.  It isn’t just the inevitable march of sea level that is an issue. Rising waters make storm surges worse. A great example is Superstorm Sandy, which hit the US East Coast in 2012. It cost approximately $65 bn of damage. The cost was higher because of sea level rise caused by global warming. Climate scientists do their best to project how much and how fast oceans will rise in the future. These projections help city planners prepare future infrastructure. My estimation is that oceans will be approximately 1 meter higher in the year 2100; that is what our infrastructure should be prepared for. What I don’t know is how much this will cost us as a society. A very recent paper was published that looked into this issue. The authors analyzed the cost of sea level if we limit the Earth to 1.5°C or 2°C warming. They also considered the future cost using “business as usual” scenarios.  What the authors found was fascinating. If humans take action to limit warming to 1.5°C, they estimate sea level will rise 52 cm by the year 2100. If humans hold global warming to 2°C, sea levels will rise by perhaps 63 cm by 2100. The difference (11 cm) could cost $1.4 tn per year if no other societal adaptation is made. This is a staggering number and in itself, should motivate us to take action. But the authors went further, they considered an even higher future temperature scenario (one that is essentially business as usual). With that future, global annual flood costs would increase to a whopping $14 tn per year.  In the study, the authors considered which countries and regions would suffer most. It turns out upper middle income countries will be worse off, particularly China. Higher-income countries have a slightly better prognosis because of their present flood protection standards. But make no mistake about it, we will all suffer and the suffering will be very costly. There are four important takeaways from this study. First, while the economic costs are large, there is some range of projections. The actual costs may be lower or higher than the median predicted in the study. This is largely due to the fact that we don’t know how fast Greenland and Antarctica will melt. If they melt faster than projected, things will be worse than what I’ve described here. Second, adaptation will help. By adaptation I mean making our societies less susceptible to sea level rise. For example, building sea walls when possible, building new infrastructure away from coasts, putting in natural breaks to limit storm surge during large storms, and making infrastructure more water-resistant. Third, what we do now matters. If we can get off the high-emissions business as usual scenarios – if we can increase investment in clean and renewable energy – we can reduce the future costs. Finally, while scientists often use 2100 as a benchmark year, it isn’t like oceans will stop rising then. In fact, we are committing ourselves to hundreds of years of rising oceans. The ocean has a lot of climate inertia. Once it starts rising, you cannot stop it. So, by focusing only on the year 2100, we are deluding ourselves into underestimating the long term costs. This research shows it’s important to connect climate science with economic science. Too often, social scientists and economists with very little climate science understanding have tried to tell us that climate change is not a problem. Whenever you hear an economist or a social scientist give you a rosy future prediction, take it with a grain of salt. Their opinion is worthless without being backed by physical understanding. And the loudest economists and social scientists often have very little of this physical understanding.\n",

      "Text: Last month was the third-hottest June on record globally, temperature data suggest, confirming 2017 will almost certainly make a hat-trick of annual climate records, with 2015, 2016 and 2017 being the three hottest years since records began. The figures also cement estimations that warming is now at levels not seen for 115,000 years, and leave some experts with little hope for limiting warming to 1.5C or even 2C. According to new figures from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), June 2017 was the third-hottest June on record, beaten only by the two preceding Junes in 2015 and 2016. The Noaa data show combined land and sea-surface temperatures for June 2017 were 0.82C above the 20th century average, making a string of 41 consecutive Junes above that average. June 2016 still holds the record at 0.92C above the 20th century average, followed by June 2015 which was 0.89C above the baseline. The data line up closely with Nasa figures released last week, which are calculated slightly differently, finding the month was the fourth-hottest on record – with June 1998 also being warmer in their data set. Based on the Nasa data, climate scientist and director of Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies Gavin Schmidt estimated that 2017 was probably going to be the second-warmest year on record after 2016, but would almost certainly be among the top three hottest years. The June data see all of the first six months of 2017 sitting among the three warmest months on record, making it the second-hottest first half of a year on record – again, beaten only by the previous year. The near-record temperatures continued this year despite the passing of El Niño, which normally warms the globe, and its opposite – La Niña – currently suppressing temperatures. The warming trend is almost certainly caused by greenhouse gas emissions – mostly the result of burning fossil fuels – with many studies showing such warm years would be almost impossible without that effect. Last year, Michael Mann from Pennsylvania State University published a paper showing the then-record temperatures in 2014 would have had less than a one in a million chance of occurring naturally. “We have a follow-up article that we’ve submitted showing that the likelihood of three consecutive record-breaking years such as we saw in 2015-2017 was similarly unlikely,” he told the Guardian over email. “In short, we can only explain the onslaught of record warm years by accounting for human-caused warming of the planet.” Andy Pitman from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia said the onslaught of very rapid warming in the past few years is likely a result of the climate system “catching up” after a period of relative slow warming caused by natural variability – the so-called “hiatus”. “I do not think the recent anomalies change anything from a science perspective,” he said. “The Earth is warming at about the long-term rates that were expected and predicted [by models].” But Pitman said the ongoing trend was “entirely inconsistent” with the target of keeping warming at just 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures. Current trends suggest the 1.5C barrier would be breached in the 2040s, with some studies suggesting it might happen much sooner. “In my view, to limit warming to 2C requires both deep and rapid cuts and a climate sensitivity on the lower end of the current range,” Pitman said. “I see no evidence that the climate sensitivity is on the lower end of the current range, unfortunately.” “It would be a good idea to cut greenhouse gas emissions rather faster than we are.”\n",

      "Text: The challenge of avoiding catastrophic climate breakdown requires “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”, according to a new IPCC report. Experts say that although the challenges are huge there is still time to create a thriving, sustainable future. The main focus is on the decisions facing governments around the world but the IPCC acknowledges the role individuals can play. Here are some of the things people can do. Although individual choices and actions are important, experts say people need to unite if the scale of this challenge is to be met, making the political space for politicians and big businesses to make the necessary changes. Bill McKibben, a leading climate campaigner and founder of 350.org, argues that the most important thing people can do is come together to form movements – or join existing groups – that can “push for changes big enough to matter”, from city-wide renewable energy programmes to large-scale divestment from fossil fuels. According to a report earlier this year, avoiding meat and dairy products is the single biggest way to reduce your environmental impact on the planet. Relatively simple measures such as insulating lofts and draft-proofing doors and windows on a large scale would see a big drop in energy consumption. However, the UK government substantially cut the amount that energy companies are forced to spend on helping households with energy efficiency measures. All that money is now focused on helping fuel-poor households, with no incentive for better-off households to improve their energy efficiency. Switch to renewable energy wherever possible. In the UK, consider installing solar panels before April, when government incentives will end and the costs will increase for most people. Walk or cycle where possible and if not – and it is available and affordable – use public transport. If you need to go by car, consider an electric one. Buy fewer things and consume less. Recycle wherever possible and – even better – reuse things. Demand a low carbon option in everything you consume, from clothes to food to energy.  Many experts – including the IPCC – say there is still a chance to create a sustainable, cleaner and more equal global system. Individuals can hold politicians to account by supporting political parties that put the environment at the heart of their economic and industrial policies. However the IPCC is clear that the real challenge from its report is to politicians, political systems and corporations rather than individuals. Jim Skea, a co-chair of the IPCC working group on mitigation said the report had presented governments “with pretty hard choices”. “We have pointed out the enormous benefits of keeping to 1.5C, and also the unprecedented shift in energy systems and transport that would be needed to achieve that,” Skea said. “We show it can be done within laws of physics and chemistry. Then the final tickbox is political will. We cannot answer that. Only our audience can – and that is the governments that receive it.”\n",

      "Text: Australians waste $10bn of food annually with “excitable” Generation Y consumers the worst offenders, according to a new report. The RaboDirect Financial Health Barometer 2016 Food and Farming Report found that households wasted up to $1,100 worth of food each year, or 14% of their weekly groceries, with one in four Gen Y consumers saying they threw out up to 20% of their weekly groceries. The report also found a correlation between food wastage and a lack of understanding about agriculture and food production. A Rabobank spokesman, Glenn Wealands, said people who rated Australian farming and food production as “not important” threw out 25% of their weekly groceries, while those who said it was “very important” threw out just 13%. The survey of 2,3000 people aged 16 to 65 also found food wastage was higher in capital cities, particularly Sydney, than in regional areas. Sydney also had the highest average weekly household spend of $163 a week, compared with $159 for New South Wales as a whole, $154 for Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory, $149 in Victoria, $146 in Western Australia and $145 in South Australia and Tasmania. Wealands said the report showed a correlation between disposable income and food waste that was most marked among Gen Y consumers, who he said were likely to have “high” financial health and greater discretionary spending because they did not have mortgage pressures. “Gen Y have a higher degree of freedom and spontaneity than the more – I’m stereotyping here – than the more restrained Gen X and baby boomers who have to follow a structure through their week,” he said. “So they’re more likely to plan with good intentions but then something more exciting comes up and that good intention that was going to be Wednesday night’s dinner gets pushed back to the back of the fridge.” He said households could remove financial stress by planning their meals and sticking to the plan, just as their parents had told them to do when they moved out of home. Ronni Kahn, the founder and chief executive of OzHarvest, an organisation that “rescues” surplus perishable food to feed vulnerable people, said actual levels of food waste were up to four times higher than the report showed. “We will have a report coming out of NSW soon that shows the amount of food wasted per household is closer to $4,000,” she said. A report by the Foodprint Melbourne Project in June found households in Melbourne wasted, on average, $2,200 worth of food a year, or 200kg of food a person. Kahn said there was a correlation between consumers being unaware of the mechanics of food production and consumers being willing to waste food. “What’s happened is we have lost that connection between what it takes to grow and what it takes to consume, and we are complacent,” she said. “As consumers we are spoiled for choice and we expect to be able to walk into a supermarket at 11pm and have the same choice that we would have at 8am.” Kahn said people were no longer taught how to budget and prepare meals by their parents, and suggested that the rise of cooking shows meant people were increasingly likely to plan and shop for elaborate meals that never eventuated. “People need to be taught that a recipe is a guide – look in your fridge and your pantry before you go to the supermarket and if you can substitute an ingredient with something you already have then do that,” she said. “They would save quite easily $3,000 to $4,000 a year.”\n",

      "Text: The little stream bubbling off the Black Mountain and tumbling 300ft down to the river Towey in the Brecon Beacons has no name and is far too small to feature on most maps. But for Welsh hill farmer Howell Williams, over whose 290 acres of steep and boggy pasture land it flows, it is an unexpected pension and a simple way to keep rural Wales populated. Directing just some of his stream’s water down a six inch pipe and into a turbine all constructed for about £50,000 generates nearly 18 kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity at peak times, and earns him £10-15,000 a year. Williams has dubbed his stream “Try dwr” – or “electricity from water”. “You work long hours on the farm and do not earn much at all, but my small stream works 24 hours a day, even when I am sleeping. The price of lamb is down this year and the European grant has decreased so these are difficult times,” he says. Helping to harvest Wales’s abundant rainfall should be a priority for any government, he says, because there are thousands of untapped streams like his pouring off hillsides in the Brecon Beacons, Snowdonia and the Berwyns. “I would say micro-hydro beats farming. This is the best pension we could possibly have. Most farmers put all they earn back into the farm but have to leave when they cannot go out in all weathers ... Now I get paid to do nothing!” Williams, 72, has always had to earn money outside the farm, working part-time in a quarry and at nearby Abercrave drift mine in the Swansea valley as a tunnel repair man. “The hill farm does not provide enough for a family. Hydro power is an added incentive to stay. It will definitely keep farmers like us on the land,” he says. While windfarms have divided Wales because of their visual intrusion and pylons, micro-hydro plants like Howell’s are popular with rural communities and farmers because they take up no more space than a shed, do negligible ecological damage and – crucially – are not owned by large, remote power companies. “The potential for micro hydro in this, one of the wettest parts of Britain, is almost limitless,” says Chris Blake, director of the Green Valleys (Wales) community interest company which since 2009 has secured licenses for nearly 50 micro hydro schemes, installed 23, and has 13 more under construction. Together TGV’s schemes generate nearly 2,000 megawatt hours (MWh) a year. The company, which on Thursday won a £10,000 Ashden community energy award, plans to install 15 schemes a year and to work beyond Wales. “We want to make micro hydro affordable and to do it at scale. We know of at least 500 sites in Wales not to mention Scotland and Cumbria, and moorland in Yorkshire and south west England. “Schemes like Howell’s are not going to make a big contribution towards slowing global warming. But they represent a step towards a low carbon economy as well as securing long-term income in areas where subsistence hill farming is the main occupation,” he says. But Blake and other micro-hydro developers in rural Wales and the west country say they cannot expand in many areas because large wind and solar companies have taken all the capacity on the grid and [the regulator] Ofgem’s rules state that private operators rather than the public money must pay for any upgrade. The privatised grid in much of rural Wales is owned by Western Power Distribution (WPD), whose parent company is US coal giant Pennsylvania Power and Light corporation. Since buying out German utility E.On’s UK power distribution company in 2011, it provides electricity to over 5m people in Wales, the Midlands and south-west England. “WPD say the grid is full for the foreseeable future in much of rural Wales and south-west England and have asked us £5.7m to upgrade the grid and connect a tiny community-owned 18kW scheme. It’s incredible,” says Blake. “Privatisation and Ofgem rules means that government targets for renewable generation cannot be met because we do not have the grid capacity,” says Blake. “The system of ownership and regulation prevents any strategic investment in the network. The result is that very many potential hydro plants like Howell’s will never get off the ground.” In a statement, WPD said: “Due to the high levels of embedded generation currently connected, or seeking connection to the distribution networks, there are areas in south Wales where significant reinforcement work is required. The contribution of the generator developer towards these costs is calculated in accordance with distribution network operator’s charging methodology as approved by the electricity regulator Ofgem. This requires the connecting generator to substantially fund the reinforcement required, rather than the cost to be borne by all the customers in south Wales.” William’s stream was harnessed five years ago and has already made his money back. “I would say that that one little stream has doubled the value of my farm because it is producing a bigger income than I can make with 300 ewes. That’s a good investment. And I can wash my Wellington boots in it.”\n",

Working for years in one place, they recognise even the footstep which goes to the manger, and intelligence reveals itself in their eyes when they turn and stoop their heads for the collar to slip on. There is then a little shrinking, half apprehension, half mental inquiry, as though in study of your character, and when you speak the glance is responsive to the tone. It is almost the same with each horse when the stubble is reached and his shoulders begin to strain. Drop the long rein on his back in an unaccustomed way and you note the twitching of his flank; it takes much gentle stroking with the palm about his head before you come slightly into favour as a friend. But once this is accomplished how much more readily work is done. Your horse, you perceive, is a skilled labourer on the land. Milder nights – a few – have brought daffodils into bloom in sheltered hollows. They are small and pale, but when, not far away, the yellower beak of the blackbird is seen digging busily it is certain that new life has come. The tips of daisies are a rich pink in the early sun. The ditch by the side of the path which leads up to the wood appears greener than yesterday; a missel-thrush is perched on an ash bough holding a stalk of straw; the honey-suckle is in leaf; just within the wood the sharp, short call of a gold-crest is heard.

The Adorers of the Blood of Christ order has filed a complaint against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in a bid to keep the pipeline off their land. The nuns’ lawyers argue in court papers that a decision by FERC to force them to accommodate the pipeline is “antithetical to the deeply held religious beliefs and convictions of the Adorers”. The Adorers, an order of 2,000 nuns across the world, have made protection of the environment central to their mission. The plan for the pipeline “goes against everything we believe in – we believe in the sustenance of all creation”, Sister Linda Fischer, 74, told the Washington Post. The 183-mile Atlantic Sunrise pipeline is “designed to supply enough natural gas to meet the daily needs of more than 7 million American homes by connecting producing regions in northeastern Pennsylvania to markets in the Mid-Atlantic and southeastern states”, its website says. It is an extension of the Transco pipeline, which runs more than 10,000 miles from from Texas to New York, and will carry gas extracted from the Marcellus shale region since fracking was permitted by the state. Williams, the company building the pipeline, wants to pay farm owners to allow it to dig up land, install the line, and return the land to farm use. It has offered compensation for lost crops and regular inspections to ascertain if the pipeline affects agricultural output. About 30 landowners who refused to do a deal with Williams now face being forced to comply by a FERC order. A section of the pipeline is planned to run underneath a strip of land owned by the Adorers in West Hempfield Township, Lancaster County, and leased to a local farmer. Earlier this month, the nuns dedicated a makeshift outdoor chapel at the site, consisting of some wooden benches and an arbour surrounded by corn, with 300 people in attendance. “We just wanted to symbolise, really, what is already there. This is holy ground,” said Sister Janet McCann. If the court rules against the nuns, Lancaster Against Pipelines, a local activist group, has pledged to mount a round-the-clock vigil at the chapel. In 2005, the nuns – whose order was founded in 1834 – adopted a “land ethic” upholding the sacredness of creation. It says the earth is a “sanctuary where all life is protected” and which must be protected for future generations. Their lawyers have told the court that the nuns’ religious beliefs include “educating and addressing important issues of social and environmental justice, such as poverty, war, racism and global warming that separates humans in a way that the Adorers do not believe mirrors their hope for the Kingdom of God”. Their conviction that the earth is part of God’s creation “compels the Adorers to exercise their religious beliefs by, inter alia, caring for and protecting the land they own as well as actively educating and engaging on issues relating to the environment, including the current and future impact on the earth caused by global warming as the result of the use of fossil fuels”.\n",

      "Text: Demand for wood-burning stoves, including in urban areas, has soared as households look for more affordable ways to stay warm during the energy crisis. Campaigners have called for stricter legislation on their use because of their negative impact on air pollution and health, with wood burning in the UK gaining in popularity over the past decade. Domestic combustion is the single biggest source of small particulate (PM2.5) air pollution in Britain, outstripping road traffic. After a series of reports about the environmental harm caused by wood-burning stoves, hundreds of people responded to a Guardian callout to share their views. Many said they used a wood-burning stove because of affordability but were careful about the fuel they used, opting for seasoned or kiln-dried wood. Estimated emissions from different types of fuel and appliances vary greatly, and since 2022, only stoves that meet the ecodesign standard can be legally sold in the UK. Many readers who responded to the callout said they owned such stoves. However, despite being far better than non-exempt stoves, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the ecodesign standard is still responsible for high amounts of PM2.5. Some readers in rural areas said they relied on their stove during power outages, while a few who lived in cities said they resented the effect solid-fuel burning was having on air quality. Others said they had changed their mind after reports on air pollution and some had chosen other ways to heat their home, such as bioethanol fires. Here, five people share their views on wood-burning stoves. Thirteen years ago we installed a Defra-approved stove to replace the existing open fire. It’s extremely high spec. It’s the only thing that keeps us properly warm and has been a godsend this past winter since the energy crisis. We’ve cut down on gas and electricity and we are using it about 70% more than last winter. Energy costs are more than previous years but it minimises the increase. I really don’t know what we would have done [otherwise]. We only burn kiln-dried wood. I don’t like it when people burn waste – you can smell it. We virtually live in the room it’s installed in as the rest of the house is so cold.Susan Cooper, 63, retired in Rugby The neighbouring houses have them and the smoke pollution in the colder months is rampant. In the past year, more people in my area are doing it for longer. The otherwise good air quality is rendered thick and irritating and the serious health risks are well documented. Continuing to burn solid fuels in urban areas wilfully ignores this information and is selfish and antisocial. It is unnecessary in modern homes. These risks and the unpleasant cloying fumes mean windows cannot be opened for fresh air. Those that have wood- and coal-burning facilities are making the rest of us pay. It should be banned wherever population density exceeds a minimum threshold.Mike, 61, builder in Devon The warm glow of bioethanol (and self-righteousness) keeps me warm in the evenings, after a decision three years ago to go against the grain of my peers and not buy a wood-burning stove and rather go for a bioethanol fire, on air quality and carbon reduction grounds. My wife thought I was being stubbornly pig-headed about it at the time but last week said: “Looks like you were right about wood-burning stoves”, having read the recent reports regarding air quality. The fire looks the same, kicks out a decent amount of heat and is, on balance, cheaper too (no flue or cleaning required).Colin Maltby, 40, project manager in Stourbridge Our wood burner has been essential in keeping us warm and our bills down. We live in a house built in 1890, so insulation isn’t great and we have only one radiator to heat the four rooms downstairs. We would really struggle without our wood burner. We are mindful to only burn sustainable, dried logs that we buy locally. If the government provided better funding to help homes insulate, perhaps we could consider installing alternative heating. You would feel more inclined to invest in heating systems if you’re not losing it out of windows and walls. The cost to insulate our walls is estimated at £14,000, and a further £10,000 to replace our old heat leaking windows – before we even look at alternative heating – making a more eco way of heating our home beyond our reach. Mel Young, 47, project planner in East Sussex “We installed a stove six years ago to replace an open fireplace as it’s more efficient and gives more heat in the living room. We live in a small village, which is not on the gas grid. The house is heated using oil but we use the stove to boost heat as it’s cheaper. Due to the absurd ways that grid-connection charges are set up for rural Scotland, we pay higher standing charges for electricity. “The wood is sourced from our garden by felling dead trees and those that need pruning. We only burn wood seasoned for at least a year and any emissions are spread far by the prevailing wind so unlikely to have any health impact. “We occasionally have power cuts in winter. The worst has been 72 hours in 2021, albeit a one-off. Without electricity we are unable to run our oil boiler and have used the stove for warmth – in the last big outage the outside temperature was -5C.”Angus Holmes, 41, works in the whisky industry in Moray\n",

      "Text: Thousands of holidaymakers heading to British beaches this summer will be cheered by a major government report into the state of the UK's seas. Coastal waters are getting cleaner, fish stocks are improving and species diversity in estuaries is increasing, according to the most authoritative examination ever carried out of UK seas. But while the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs study boasts of \"significant improvements\" since the last such report in 2005, it also paints a picture of an environment being rapidly affected by a warming world. Seas around the British Isles are higher, warmer and more acid, it says, and coastal litter levels are at a record high. The sea surface temperature of UK waters has risen on average by between 0.5 and 1C since the 1870s, which could affect the fish that appear on our plates in future. Of the 330 species found around the UK, cold-water species such as cod are in retreat, while warm-water fish including red-mullet, seabass and John Dory are spreading rapidly. Fish stocks are improving overall, partly due to fishing reductions brought about by European Union quotas, despite criticism from marine conservation groups that the quotas are set too high to maintain fish stocks. The proportion of fin-fish stocks in UK waters being harvested sustainably has risen from 10% in the early 1990s to 25% in 2007. However, the report notes that a large majority of stocks are still being fished at unsustainable levels. Fish are simultaneously being hit by warming waters, which are causing the cold and warm water zooplankton that fish feed on to move north. The warm water zooplankton tend to be smaller and less nutritious, affecting fish larvae and stocks. Climate change is also causing sea levels to rise, with the mean sea level rising by 1.4mm per year in the 20th century. While slower than global growth of 1.7mm per year in the same period, the rise has not always been steady - in the 1990s, it was going up by 3-4mm each year. More coastal erosion and more flooding are likely to occur as a result, says the report, with the Humber estuary and Norfolk coast particularly at risk. UK waters are also not exempt from the global trend of ocean acidifiation due to higher levels of dissolved CO2. This leads to harmful effects for marine life that rely on calcification, such as crustacea and molluscs. But the authors of the report admit the lack of a baseline for pH levels makes it hard to measure the rate of our acidifying seas. Levels of pollution continue to drop since Defra's research in 2005, including heavy metals such as lead and mercury. However, there are still some localised problems such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) which, while stabilising nationally, are still found in places at levels that affect wildlife, including harbour porpoises. Litter levels doubled, though, between 1994 and 2007, with 2,000 items per kilometre of coastline. Litter was even found at a depth of 1,000 metres. The picture for waterbirds and seabirds is mixed. Waterbird numbers are largely healthy, with the 2006/2007 population numbers 85% above levels in the 1970s. But seabirds have seen a 9% decrease in numbers since 2005, with herring gull numbers down over 50% since 1969. Seabirds are suffering particularly badly in north and north-west Scotland, due to the arrival of invasive species such as rat and mink, which affect nesting sites. The evidence in the report was gathered from peer-reviewed science provided by universities, government agencies, NGOs and industry. Marine environment minister Richard Benyon said: \"The report's findings show that we are moving in the right direction, but there is more work that needs to be done, especially to protect the UK's seabirds. I am committed to improving our marine environment by delivering the conservation measures in the Marine and Coastal Access Act and hope to see further improvements in the next report as we gain the benefits from Marine Conservation Zones.\" In January, Lundy Island off the north Devon coast became England's first Marine Conservation Zone.\n",

      "Text: Planet-heating emissions roared back in the United States in 2021, dashing hopes that the pandemic would prove a watershed moment in greening American society to address the climate crisis, new figures have shown. Following the onset of the pandemic in 2020, millions of people switched to working from home, car and airplane travel plummeted and industrial output slowed. This led to a sharp drop in greenhouse gas emissions, spurring predictions that a newly shaped American economy would emerge to help banish the era of fossil fuels. These forecasts may well have been baseless, however, with the new research showing that US emissions rose by 6.2% last year, compared to 2020. While emissions were still 5% down from 2019 levels, the jump in pollution as people returned to previous rhythms of life was greater than last year’s overall economic growth. “We expected a rebound but it’s dismaying that emissions came back even faster than the overall economy,” said Kate Larsen, a partner at Rhodium Group, the independent research firm that conducted the analysis. “We aren’t just reducing the carbon intensity of the economy, we are increasing it. We are doing exactly the opposite of what we need to be doing.” The leap in emissions in 2021 was largely down to an increase in cars and trucks on the road, with a 10% growth in transportation emissions from a year previously as Americans, and their goods, started moving again amid optimism spurred by the rollout of vaccines. Coal, the dirtiest of fossil fuels that has been in a steady decline in the US, also made an unwelcome return, with its use in power generation posting a 17% increase on 2020. Emissions from industrial processes rose by 6.6% last year, while emissions from the use of buildings edged up slightly. US emissions have been on a gradual decline since around 2005, primarily because of market conditions that have made coal uncompetitive and gas, a less polluting fossil fuel, attractive to utilities as a cheap and abundant alternative. Despite more than three decades of increasingly urgent warnings from climate scientists, and a growing parade of catastrophic wildfires, floods and heatwaves, the US has never put in place any national legislation to deal with the climate crisis. Larsen said it is “critically important” for Congress to pass climate measures in the Build Back Better spending bill that has been stalled by Senator Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat from West Virginia who has deep ties to the coal industry. “There was hope this pandemic would bring about wholesale changes, but we aren’t seeing that across the board,” said Larsen. “More importantly, we need to decarbonize our economy and not just bet on individual behaviour changing. “It’s concerning that we rely upon the oil and gas market to lower emissions and even more concerning we have not passed the rules and laws we need. It was always going to be an uphill battle for the US and now that hill is even steeper.” The uptick in emissions in 2021 has thrown the US off track in the rate of cuts required to meet the internationally agreed targets articulated in the Paris climate accords. The deal states that countries must try to keep the global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, a point beyond which scientists warn the world will face dire impacts. “We’ve got to come down from the peak, in fact halfway down to zero, within this decade if we are to remain on course to keep warming below a catastrophic 1.5C,” said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University. “There was progress at Cop26 but there needs to be much more. And for the US to be able to do its part, we need the climate provisions of Build Back Better to pass Congress as soon as possible.”\n",

      "Text: Australia needs to work faster on lifting water quality to save the Great Barrier Reef, according to its first progress report to Unesco since the world heritage site was spared an “in-danger” listing. The report admitted that a key plank of Australia’s conservation plan – land-clearing reforms in Queensland to staunch water pollution – had failed. It also highlighted climate change, which is the biggest threat to the reef and led to the worst recorded coral bleaching in its history this year, but which the plan makes no attempt to address. But the Australian government reports “good progress” over the first 18 months of its Reef 2050 plan, citing limits on new port developments and a ban on dumping in reef waters the spoil from the dredging of shipping channels. Australia had clinched an “investment framework” that mapped out $1.28bn in spending over the next five years, with $716m from the federal government, $409m from the Queensland government and $161m from “other sources”. The report noted “no undertaking of comparable scope, complexity and financial commitment has been attempted in a marine environment or world heritage site”. While the priority was to lift the quality of water running into the reef and things were “steadily” improving, the update flagged the “need to accelerate our progress towards the ambitious targets that have been set”. The update pointed to the 2015 reef report card – written before bleaching this year wiped out about a quarter of all coral – which still gave the reef a “D” for its overall health for the fifth year in a row. Progress in cutting nitrogen pollution was “very poor” and improving farm practices “poor”, it said, with Queensland poised next year to bring in tougher laws governing use of fertiliser. On funding the water-quality targets, the report acknowledged a Queensland government study showing it would cost $8.2bn over 10 years. But it then indicated it wasn’t willing to invest the required amount. “The diminishing return on investment for the more expensive interventions makes these options impractical to implement at this time,” the update said. The Queensland environment minister, Steven Miles, said he was confident the report would be enough to avert fresh consideration of a Unesco “in-danger” listing as it “demonstrates that we’ve done everything we can to be on track” with conservation plans. Miles said a “lot of those big important things” such as the ban on dredge spoil dumping, limits on new ports and reef water-quality investment were under way. “However, given the bleaching event, given the failure of the Queensland parliament to pass the land-clearing laws, and also given the continuing slow progress towards the water-quality targets, there’s obviously some concerns out there,” he said. “If this goes to a debate about in-danger listing, the responsibility will rest at the feet of the [state Liberal National opposition] who, despite claiming credit for the plan, then refused to support a key element of the plan, land-clearing laws. “We know that land clearing is driving massive amounts of sediment out on to the reef and that is one of the biggest threats to the reef.” Miles said bleaching had increased the focus on the failure of the promised land-clearing reforms, which the Queensland Labor government vowed to push through if it won the next election. “Having said that there is a lot of progress and a lot of commitment particularly from the state and commonwealth governments and I think the global community is likely to see that for what it is and recognise we need more time to demonstrate we can get these things on track,” he said. The federal environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, said the report showed “significant progress” and that “the blueprint for a new era in reef protection has been established for ongoing cooperation and collaboration involving governments, science, industries and communities”. “The update highlights that of the 151 actions scheduled in the initial five years, 32 have been completed and another 103 are under way and on track.” Miles said Australia’s reef conservation plan mainly dealt with “localised” threats. A market-based mechanism for pricing carbon was needed to address the reef’s biggest threat of climate change, he said. “We’ve actually been damaging the reef for decades through what we’ve done up and down the coast. So we need to address those things if we’re going to give the reef any chance of surviving.” Miles said Queensland was poised to introduce tougher regulations about the use of fertiliser in early 2017, with the sugar cane industry in particular having “a long way to go” in cleaning up its act “enough to actually have an impact on water quality”. The report made frequent mention of the bleaching event that hit the reef this year but it didn’t earmark any further funding for conservation action in response. Ian Chubb, chair of the independent expert advisory committee and former Australian chief scientist, wrote an introductory note emphasising the dire threat climate change meant for the reef. Chubb said global action on climate change would be “paramount” but that it must be coupled with initiatives to reduce other pressures. Penelope Wensley, chair of reef 2050 advisory committee, said in an introductory note that the plan “represents the best possible chance for the reef” and “we cannot afford to fail”. Progress was pleasing, she said, but “we have to quicken the pace”. She said many committee members were “calling for stronger action and a greater investment of effort and resources to accelerate progress towards achieving the targets, objectives and outcomes of the reef 2050 plan”. Before seeing the update, the Greens senator Larissa Waters said the government risked “failing its homework” by underfunding the reef plan, delaying water quality targets, spruiking new coal and ignoring global warming.\n",

      "Text: Air pollution from fossil fuel use is killing 5 million people worldwide every year, a death toll much higher than previously estimated, according to the largest study of its kind. The stark figures, published on the eve of the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai, will increase pressure on world leaders to take action. Among the decisions they must make at the UN conference will be whether to agree, for the first time, to gradually “phase out” fossil fuels. Research has shown that switching from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy sources would save many lives from air pollution and help combat global heating. However, until now, mortality estimates have varied widely. A new modelling study suggests air pollution, from the use of fossil fuels in industry, power generation, and transportation, accounts for 5.1 million avoidable deaths a year globally. These findings were published in The BMJ. The contribution of fossil fuels equates to 61% of a total estimated 8.3 million deaths worldwide due to outdoor air pollution from all sources in 2019. The new estimates of fossil fuel-related deaths are larger than most previously reported values, suggesting that phasing out fossil fuels might have a greater impact on attributable mortality than previously thought. “Our results suggest that a global phase-out of fossil fuels will have large health benefits, much larger than indicated by most previous studies,” the global team of researchers wrote in the BMJ. “These data support increasing the share of clean, renewable energy, advocated by the UN through the sustainable development goals for 2030 and the ambition of climate neutrality for 2050.” Ambient air pollution is the leading environmental health risk factor for illness and death, but few global studies have attributed deaths to specific air pollution sources and their results widely differ. To address this, an international team of researchers from the UK, US, Germany, Spain and Cyprus, used a new model to estimate deaths due to air pollution related to fossil fuels, and to assess potential health benefits from policies that replace fossil fuels with clean, renewable energy sources. They assessed excess deaths using data from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study, as well as Nasa satellite-based fine particulate matter and population data, and atmospheric chemistry, aerosol, and relative risk modelling for 2019. The results show that in 2019, 8.3 million deaths worldwide were attributable to fine particles (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) in ambient air, of which 61% (5.1 million) were linked to fossil fuels. “Major reductions in air pollution emissions, notably through a phase-out of fossil fuels, could have large, positive health outcomes. Results show that the mortality burden attributable to air pollution from fossil fuel use is higher than most previous estimates,” the researchers wrote. They said one reason for their model producing larger estimates than most previous studies was its being based solely on studies of outdoor air pollution. Uncertainty remained but given the Paris climate agreement’s goal of climate neutrality by 2050, “the replacement of fossil fuels by clean, renewable energy sources would have tremendous public health and climate co-benefits”.\n",

      "Text: An orange flame on your stove would be the signal that you were now burning “renewable gas”, the advertorial said, promising this would happen “sooner than you expect”. Above the article, which ran in the Age last week, was an advert from pipeline and distribution company Australian Gas Networks (AGN) showing a gas flame burning an unfamiliar green with the words “renewable gas”. So what is “renewable gas” and how long might it be before the promise of the industry’s advertising turns into a reality? The impression from some of the current advertising might be that this green gas nirvana is just around the corner. On Facebook, AGN is currently running a 10-second advert where a blue gas flame turns green with the words: “The journey towards 100% Renewable Gas (using green hydrogen) has already started. Learn more about it and how we’re using it to reduce carbon emissions in the gas network.” In October and November last year, AGN ran an almost identical version of the advert that was seen more than one million times, according to Facebook data. A few weeks ago, another gas network operator – Jemena – ran an advertorial in the Sydney Morning Herald, which declared: “Renewable gas can satisfy our energy hunger.” So what’s going on? The industry is using the term “renewable gas” to describe both hydrogen made using renewable energy and biomethane that can be produced from organic waste such as human or animal sewage or food. Both these forms of gas would be considered carbon-neutral – or close to carbon-neutral – because they’re not liberating carbon that was sequestered millions of years ago. According to the latest government data, Australia currently consumes 1,647 petajoules (PJ) of gas per year, of which households use only 175 PJ. This compares with 16.4 PJ of biogas consumed (mostly at landfill sites). AGN, which has 2.1 million home and business customers, says in its advertorial that renewable gas is coming “sooner than you think” but in its environmental and social governance report, it says it has a target to have 10% renewable gas in its network by 2030. There’s a “stretch target” for all the gas to be renewable by 2040 or at the latest by 2050. If this is “sooner than you think” then congratulations. A statement from Australian Gas Infrastructure Group, which owns AGN, said: “It is still early days for the renewable gas industry, but AGIG, with the support of state governments, has clear targets to transitioning to renewable gas.” A demonstration site at Hydrogen Park South Australia has delivered renewable gas blends to 700 homes and would be extended to more homes in Adelaide. The statement said: “There is much work to do, as renewable gas has been in development for a relatively short time, but our customers strongly support our investment in this area.” Theoretically, biomethane can be a straight swap for fossil gas without the need for people to change their cookers and other appliances. The same can’t be said for hydrogen. Once blends get to about 20%, AGIG said “some appliances will need modification or replacement” and the company was working with appliance makers. Jemena told Temperature Check it had identified enough sources of biomethane to completely replace the fossil gas in its network. But this is different from actually having plants generate that gas. When Temperature Check asked how much carbon-neutral gas it was currently blending, the company said there was “broad consensus that we could integrate as much as 20% biomethane and 20% hydrogen by 2030 across the gas network”. Senator Hollie Hughes is the Coalition’s shadow assistant climate change and energy minister, and this week she was out barracking for coal. “Australia has some of the most amazing coal in the world,” she told Sky News, saying Australia should be using more of it, not less. Did I say this was the shadow assistant climate change minister? Anyway, Hughes also had a message for the viewers about solar and wind power. “Renewables do not exist in a transmissible form that can deliver that kind of energy regardless of what anyone says. You can say it all you like. The technology does not exist. “We need to live in the real world, not off with the fairies and the pixie dust. What might be available in the future does not exist yet.” Two weeks ago the pixies at the Australian Energy Market Operator released their latest version of a plan to decarbonise the energy grid and deliver affordable and reliable electricity. The plan did not call for any new inventions to bring into existence things that don’t currently exist (I have not checked with the Australian Energy Market Operator whether any pixie dust was used in producing the report, or if any fairies were harmed in its production, but I suspect the answer would be no on both counts). Rather, the plan said more investment was needed in things that do exist such as solar and wind power, batteries, energy storage and improvements and extensions to the transmission grid. “Investment in low-cost renewable energy, firming resources and essential transmission remains the best strategy to deliver affordable and reliable energy, protected against international market shocks,” the report said. The country’s “amazing coal” exports produce almost double Australia’s domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Australia’s existing solar and wind resources don’t do that.\n",

      "Text: After years of economic uncertainty and falling living standards, the 2015 election will have a defensive feel to it. The electorate will want reassurance, not big change. Whoever ends up in government will be pursuing small \"c\" conservative ends: stability and security. The 2010 general election was not a cautious one. The banking crisis required national renewal and David Cameron, in optimistic mode, issued a manifesto invitation for the public to \"join the government of Britain\". All three parties promised \"revolutions\" in green technology. But 2015 will hear of no revolutions, and little of what Sarah Palin called the \"hopey changey thing\". The winner will be whoever offers the best parenting for a fragile and unbalanced economy. So what might an environmental agenda for stability look like? First, it would find ways of supporting those struggling with the rising cost of living. Nothing is as destabilising as rising inequality. Finding common cause with the fuel and resource-poor requires a different approach, as pioneered by the Energy Bill Revolution, which has corralled hundreds of NGOs behind its campaign to eradicate fuel poverty. Second, an environmental agenda would focus on making Britain more resilient. It would target infrastructure, which appears to collapse every winter, and the economy, which is currently driven by volatile consumption rather than steady investment. And it would address the stagnation of large parts of the country outside the south-east. Finally, it has to protect the everyday urban and suburban places that people love, as well as the best rural habitats, as these are the environments that most of us inhabit and cherish. Cost of living Politicians haven't been straight with the public about how vulnerable the UK is to international commodity markets and rising global resource prices have played a big role in falling living standards. Green Alliance's analysis (pdf) shows that real wages could have actually risen over the past decade without the extra inflation caused by faster rises in international energy and food prices. The great resource price shock means that the average British household has paid an extra £1,000 a year for food and energy. Global trade may help to smooth the upward price curve, but only resource stewardship can help to bring it down if global demand keeps on rising. We must support homes and businesses to conserve more energy, help farmers sell the 40% of food supermarkets reject on cosmetic grounds, and keep the £3.5bn of materials thrown away every year out of landfill. A coherent resource stewardship programme could start by encouraging councils to become resource entrepreneurs, recovering more of the waste we throw away and reinvesting the income generated into reducing household energy bills. Economic resilience All parties are committed to multibillion pound capital expenditure on infrastructure, but new runways and the dualling of more A roads will make the UK less resilient to increasing energy prices or efforts to rebalance the economy. Obama's 'fix it first' approach in the US (fill potholes, make the railways more robust, refurbish old leaky homes and strengthen flood defences) gives a much greater return on investment than new infrastructure, and could benefit all parts of the UK. Another approach would be to invest in smart systems that make our infrastructure more efficient. London's smart-ticketing system should be rolled out to our eight core cities. Microchips that allow electrical products to turn off at periods of high demand could be interconnected with the not-yet-smart meters that we are about to have installed in our homes. Negawatt (energy saving) incentives for business and homes could be scaled up to reduce demand on power stations. Every government loves to champion some big kit because they want to be seen as visionary. They often struggle to deliver large-scale low-carbon infrastructure because it requires them to commit unequivocally to the long term. But low carbon already makes up the biggest chunk of the Treasury's pipeline of planned infrastructure projects. These clean energy projects are largely going to be delivered by the private sector and could stimulate the growth of new industry outside London. The electoral benefits are considerable. If the next government is really serious about infrastructure it should hand over its capital spend to the green investment bank, which has already proven it can work with the private sector, and thus avoid jeopardising the programme through ministerial interference. Beauty Because of the sense that all of Britain land is up for grabs, the first party to identify a non-negotiable area of beauty will stand out. As Oliver Letwin wrote in his essay Why beauty matters in 2007, \"a life amid ugliness is one of the most important forms of deprivation and the search for beauty is one of the great motivations of the human spirit.\" Any party that promises some real protection for village greens and beautiful views will win plaudits. The next government will reflect the public's mood by being cautious in its ends, but it could deliver greater stability and wellbeing through muscular green means. It's time to develop positive proposals for protective government, whoever that turns out to be.  Matthew Spencer is director of the thinktank Green Alliance\n",

      "Text: For a half hour in the middle of a Saturday last month, enough renewable energy was available to meet all but 1.4% of eastern Australia’s entire electricity demand – the closest to reaching 100% clean power in the grid’s history. Renewables also supplied 38.9% of average demand across the national electricity market (Nem) in the September quarter, the most for any third quarter, according to a report by the Australian energy market operator (Aemo). Total carbon emissions from the power sector, Australia’s biggest single source, were down 11% on a year ago. The share of generation from gas fell by almost a third and black coal by 7.5%, even though both fuels were slapped with price caps this year by the Albanese government. Sunny skies as rain clouds disappeared contributed to an abundance of solar output, driving prices on the wholesale spot market negative for 19% of the time. That proportion was more than double that of the September quarter of 2022, and smashed the previous record 9.2% share in the June quarter of this year. For the September quarter, wholesale power prices in the Nem averaged $63 per megawatt hour, down 41% on the previous three months and 71% lower than a year earlier, as Guardian Australia reported. Average wholesale gas prices on the east coast cratered to $10.41 per gigajoule from $25.94/GJ a year earlier. Wholesale price reductions, though, would need to be sustained to make much difference to households’ retail energy bills. These are typically set annually.   Electricity demand is also expected to reverse recent declines, with prospects of a hot summer firming as an El Niño takes hold. Air-conditioner use was limited during the past three relatively damp and cool La Niña summers. During the noon-12.30pm period on 16 September, renewables met a record 70% of power demand in the Nem, including 39% from rooftop solar. Clean energy was sufficient to meet almost all demand in eastern Australia and Tasmania. “Potential renewable output hit a record 98.6%, which combines dispatched generation and available wind and solar farms that were bidding above the spot price and therefore not dispatched into the wholesale market,” said Violette Mouchaileh, an Aemo executive. Despite the September quarter covering most of winter, when sun irradiance is relatively low, rooftop solar output reached as much as 11.9 gigawatts, 3% more than the previous record. Solar farms’ maximum output during the quarter also rose 7% from its previous quarterly peak to just under 6GW, while wind farms generated as much 8GW, or 10% more than their previous high. Challenges continue to mount for the Nem’s dwindling fleet of coal- and gas-fired power plants. One issue is that demand is often low, particularly during the middle of the day when many customers are sourcing power from their rooftops. A half-hour spell on Sunday 17 September saw operational demand slump to 11.393GW, almost 0.5GW below the previous Nem low set on 6 November 2022.. South Australia’s supplies from the grid almost disappeared entirely during a 30-minute stint on 16 September, with operational demand at a record low of just 21MW.  New South Wales and Victoria also set record minimum operational demands during the quarter, while Queensland had its lowest since 2002. The market easily absorbed the closure in April of AGL Energy’s Liddell power station in NSW’s Hunter Valley.   Other NSW coal plants expanded available capacity but actual average output sank 166MW as they struggled to compete with renewables. Aemo will provide an update next month about the grid’s readiness to cope with expected extra demand this summer. Mouchaileh said 1.7GW of new renewable plants were “progressing through registration”, with a further 10GW of plants finalising contracts and under construction. “The pipeline of new renewables, if supported by firming generation – batteries, hydro and gas – and transmission, will help meet reliability gaps and share low-cost, low-emissions energy to homes and businesses,” she said.\n",

      "Text: The UK’s greenhouse gas emissions plunged by 8.4% last year, as household energy consumption slumped, the use of coal for electricity generation fell, and policies on climate change took effect, according to government statistics released on Thursday. Carbon dioxide output fell by almost a tenth, as renewable energy generation rose to a new record high, accounting for nearly a fifth of electricity. It was the biggest fall in emissions since 1990. Over the last five years, following a sharp fall in 2009, emissions appeared to have reached a plateau, with slight rises in some years owing to increasing coal use. The price of coal has dropped on world markets, as shale gas has sapped demand in the US, leaving a glut. Green campaigners welcomed the fall, but they warned that more must be done to reach targets. In part, the slump in carbon output was down to record average high temperatures across the UK in 2014, which drove down demand for heating and led to a big drop in household energy consumption – even though bills rose over the year. The emissions fall was a boost to Ed Davey, secretary of state for energy and climate change, ahead of a difficult general election for the Lib Dems. The party has traditionally relied on its green credentials with voters, but this has been a harder sell when in coalition. Davey said: “2014 was truly record-breaking year for low carbon generation. Our plan to decarbonise the economy while it grows is working – we’ve reduced our emissions by 8%, increased the amount of electricity we’re getting from renewables and seen the economy grow at the same time. It is crucial we continue to build a low carbon energy sector based on home grown sources, as it is crucial to improving our energy security, as well as stimulating economic growth and reducing emissions.” The fall will also strengthen the UK’s position at the Paris climate talks this December, where world governments are expected to agree to greenhouse gas targets to take effect beyond 2020, when current pledges expire. By 31 March, all countries are expected to submit their proposals on how far they will cut emissions, in the case of developed countries, and on proposed curbs to their emissions growth, in the case of poorer nations. Some may miss the deadline, but the EU, the US and China have already made public their pledges. These pledges will then be considered to decide how fair they are and how far they take the world to the cuts in greenhouse gases needed to prevent global warming from exceeding 2C, regarded as the threshold of safety, beyond which climate change is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.  Emma Pinchbeck of WWF said: “Falling carbon emissions from the energy sector is welcome news and shows that action on carbon emissions gets results. While this drop is positive, we must remember that more ambitious carbon emissions reductions are required across different sectors to meet our climate change commitments.” Green groups pointed to the rise in renewable energy generation, which hit 19% last year, as a key factor in the emissions fall. However, the future of onshore wind – the biggest and cheapest generator of large-scale renewable power – is in doubt as an incoming Conservative government would end subsidies for the technology and might bring in tougher regulations on the building of new wind farms. Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK, said: “This is further evidence, if it was needed, that efforts to cut carbon and boost our economy can go hand in hand. Since a reduction in coal use was a crucial factor in bringing down carbon dioxide emissions, these figures give us a taste of what could be achieved if our political leaders got serious about phasing out the dirtiest of all fossil fuels and gave proper backing to clean energy.”\n",

      "Text: Last month the government made a landmark decision to reduce the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions to zero sometime this century. This makes Britain the first country to commit to one of the key pledges in the Paris climate agreement reached last December. This decision was prompted by a tireless, non-partisan campaign led by former Labour leader Ed Miliband, the UK’s first ever secretary of state for energy and climate change. Securing this commitment is an important new climate milestone for Miliband, who played a key role in establishing the UK Climate Change Act when he was in government. The decision is also a testament to the ongoing cross-party commitment to tackle climate change which originally allowed the Climate Change Act to be adopted. But while we should take a moment to welcome the symbolic advance that has been made, a major issue with the UK’s flagship climate policy still remains unresolved and it is much more pressing. The Climate Change Act was rightly held up as a groundbreaking piece of environmental legislation, the poster-child policy for global climate leadership. The act set an ambitious long-term target to cut UK emissions by 80% from 1990 levels by 2050, introduced an independent Climate Change Committee to chart an affordable course to that 2050 target, and established a system of five-year carbon budgets to ratchet national emissions down progressively over time. But at some point shortly after this historic environmental victory – when the streamers had all been popped and the champagne had all been drunk – the lawyers and the accountants were called in to write the rules for our carbon budgets and somewhere along the way they decided to get a little creative. The result of that creative accounting is something worthy of the Panama Papers. Our world-leading carbon budgets have been given feet of clay. While they pretend to limit emissions from the whole British economy, they only actually police half of them. The other half has been offloaded to the EU Emissions Trading scheme, which acts as a kind of offshore carbon haven. While the European carbon market is supposed to drive emissions reductions on the UK’s behalf, it is notoriously broken, and is still struggling to maintain a carbon price above a meagre €5 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted – and this despite numerous political interventions to fix it over the past decade. With the stroke of a pen the technocrats quietly absolved government of all responsibility to reduce emissions from some of the most obvious and most tractable sources of pollution in the land: the fossil-fuel devouring power stations and factories whose smokestacks belch millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year – not to mention huge amounts of other pollutants which damage our health more directly than CO2. It’s incredible to think that the carbon budgets established under the Climate Change Act have not prompted the installation of a single solar panel or wind turbine and haven’t required a single coal-fired power station to close. But by virtue of their design they could not drive this change. These specific carbon abatement measures have either been driven by European directives or by completely independent domestic political pressures and rules. We are obliged, then, to pose a new question. As the government prepares to adopt the fifth carbon budget in June – the budget that will control emissions from the year 2028 to 2032 – we need to ask not only what level that budget will be set at, but how it will be measured. Will it be an honest budget that does what it says on the tin, or will it be a budget that can be met through loopholes and accounting tricks? We should soon find out. As the energy bill returns to the House of Lords on Tuesday, and both houses negotiate the final legislation, a key amendment to fix the accounting rules is still up for grabs. This is our opportunity to straighten out the books and change the rules so the government is accountable for keeping all national emissions within the UK carbon budgets. This proposal to close the reporting loopholes is backed by the Labour party, the Lib Dems, the Scottish National party, the Greens and others. It also has the support of NGOs including the RSPB, Sandbag, Greenpeace, Client Earth and WWF. The Conservative party’s manifesto says they will “continue to support the UK Climate Change Act”. The question right now is, will they help to fix it?\n",

      "Text: In a connected world, with scientists warning rapid emissions cuts are needed to address the climate crisis, the Marinus Link reads as an elegant solution. A proposed 1,500 megawatt undersea electricity cable between Burnie, in north-west Tasmania, and Gippsland in Victoria, it would quadruple the amount of electricity that can be sent in either direction across Bass Strait. As of Monday, the $3.5bn project is earmarked to have its environmental and planning approvals fast-tracked after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, included it on a list of 15 priority projects. But while Marinus Link has broad political support, it is three years from a final investment decision, does not yet have anyone to pay for it and has been sharply criticised by Tasmania’s most high-profile environment campaigners. Some energy analysts say it is unclear when, or even if, its electricity will be needed. The case for the link is straightforward. Unlike the rest of the country, Tasmania already runs on near 100% clean hydro energy. The federal and state governments plan to increase hydro capacity through the “battery of the nation” project, which would introduce pumped hydro storage – additional generation capacity that could be called on when needed to back up wind and solar. The north of Tasmania is also particularly gusty, making it well suited for wind farms. The Liberal state government has set a target of 200% renewable energy by 2040 and is eyeing possible clean export industries. Victoria, on the other hand, gets about three-quarters of its electricity from the dirtiest coal power stations in the country. As these ageing plants close in the years ahead, it and other mainland states will need to be able to call on a range of flexible energy sources to “firm” variable renewable energy. Better connection between the states is considered a key part of this. Guy Barnett, the Tasmanian energy minister, puts it simply. “We have what the rest of Australia wants and needs – affordable, reliable and clean electricity.” With the existing 500 megawatt Basslink often running at full capacity, Barnett says Marinus Link is needed to deliver this vision. The state has three earmarked renewable energy zones for development. “There are rich pickings for wind developers and the opportunities are massive,” he says. Government-owned agency TasNetworks says the project is expected to be delivered in two 750 megawatt halves, two years apart. Some appraisals have suggested it could be the first of many further cable links across the strait. The proponents estimate the project would create 2,800 direct and indirect jobs during construction, pumping stimulus into the two states’ economies. But little of that stimulus would be immediate. An investment decision is not expected until 2023-24, and it would then take about four years from manufacturing to commissioning. Among the unanswered questions is who will pay for it. Some Tasmanian analysts have expressed concern that the state will be picking up the tab for a project built to solve a problem across Bass Strait. Barnett says the Coag energy council commissioned an assessment of the fair distribution of costs, with a report expected in September. Morrison’s priority listing is unlikely to bring forward the development, but Bess Clark, general manager of the project at TasNetworks, says it will make a difference. “Having a more streamlined process is very helpful because it helps to de-risk the project investment decision,” she says. The renewable energy industry strongly backs the project. Kane Thornton, chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, says it will be critical to bring on more wind and solar projects in southern Australia and drive down power prices. “These are long-term projects that will provide steady, secure and value-adding employment in Australia.” But views within Tasmanian environment groups are mixed. Among the strongest opponents are Tasmania’s best known conservationists and campaigners, the former Australians Greens leaders Bob Brown and Christine Milne. Brown argues the project does not stand up economically without subsidies, and some of the proposed wind farms would turn pristine wilderness areas into an “industrial landscape” with little benefit for locals. He is particularly incensed by the 100km-long easement that would need to be cleared to connect the cable to the proposed $1.6bn Robbins Island wind farm in the state’s far north-west, fearing it would cut through Tarkine wilderness. The hero of the Franklin Dam campaign says renewable energy is developing rapidly and would continue without Marinus Link. “The idea that Tasmania is somehow the saviour from fossil fuels is absurd,” Brown says. Barnett accuses Brown of “appalling hypocrisy” and says all projects would be “subject to rigorous development and environmental approvals” and measures to minimise impacts on threatened species. One of the most challenging questions about the project to answer is what the electricity market would look like in the latter part of the decade should it go ahead. Sceptics point out that a draft feasibility study published in December suggested 7,000MW of coal-fired power – equivalent to five or six large plants on top of the Liddell power station, which is scheduled to close in 2023 – would need to exit the market for it to be economically viable. While the federal government is a strong supporter of Marinus Link, it has previously indicated it wants coal generators to run as long as possible. No plan has been laid out for plants to shut at a certain timeframe to make room for new planned major investments such as those in Tasmania and the expansion of the Snowy Hydro. Clark says the suggestion that 7,000MW of coal would need to be retired was as result of “trying to be simple” in explaining what a future grid might look like. In reality, she says, complex modelling suggests Marinus Link is an optimal part of a future grid under a range of scenarios. Others think there are plenty of questions yet to be answered. Tennant Reed, an energy adviser at the Australian Industry Group, says Morrison’s announcement of a more rapid approval process does not hurt, but the main thing holding the Tasmanian plans back is uncertainty about when mainland power stations will shut. “Unless that comes, you could approve the project tomorrow and it still wouldn’t commence til past 2030,” Reed says. “Marinus and the battery of the nation sit among many options for grid flexibility as old coal retires. We don’t know which will be best, but getting the whole economy to net zero emissions by 2050 is going to require a lot of smart investments.”\n",

      "Text: Breanna Owens had no idea where to turn for help when the wolves arrived. The northern California-based rancher used to take her cattle to graze each summer in Oregon, but in 2014, OR-7, a solitary wolf dubbed Journey, found a mate and produced a litter of pups in the vicinity of Owens’ herd. The Rogue pack was the first in the area in generations. “All of a sudden it’s, ‘Oh, he set up camp. And there’s a female. And there’s pups – oh my gosh!’” she recalled. Four years later, Owens again finds herself in wolf country. Another pack has settled in the northern California mountains where she and other ranchers graze sheep and cattle. It’s news that has environmentalists celebrating – wolves were extirpated from the state in the 1920s – and ranchers wringing their hands amid a handful of livestock killings. But Owens is taking a remarkably contrarian tack: rather than calling for the removal of wolves, she’s working to ensure safe coexistence with the canines. Gray wolves were long seen as livestock-killing vermin and were driven nearly to extinction by the early 1900s. They were listed as endangered in 1978, and in 1995 a reintroduction effort began in Yellowstone. Packs have since established themselves throughout the northern Rocky Mountains and in Washington and Oregon. When the Rogue pack arrived, Owens had plenty of questions: did she need to be concerned? What actions could she take? When would the wolves start exhibiting hunting behavior? Owens turned to an unlikely ally: Karin Vardaman, then a director with the California Wolf Center, a not-for-profit group dedicated to rebuilding the state’s long-lost wolf population. Vardaman knew conflicts over wolves were imminent, and that a working relationship with ranchers would both minimize cattle predation and the chance of wolves being killed in retaliation. Accordingly, she began meeting with livestock producers across the state’s northern reaches. “People in urban areas get excited,” said Vardaman, now with the advocacy group Defenders of Wildlife. “But they’re not impacted when wolves return.” She formed the Working Circle Proactive Stewardship, and Owens eventually signed on as its director. It suggests a suite of non-lethal wolf deterrents, including fladry (small red flags) and flashing lights, which can startle predators, and guard dogs. It teaches tactics such as bunching cattle together and rotating them around grazing areas, which not only keeps wolves at bay, it also better allows grass to regenerate. And it trains and funds range stewards, who spend time in the field with cattle, observing how best to manage the herd and protect it from predators. The question could not be more pressing: the new California pack, the Lassen pack, now consists of at least two adults, two yearlings and five pups, and has killed at least four calves since July. Todd Swickard suffered one such depredation. On 19 September, one of his ranch hands found a partially consumed calf, which state biologists confirmed was killed by a wolf. Swickard was in the process of shipping his cattle out of their summer grazing terrain, so there wasn’t much risk of further losses. But the specter of wolves’ continuing presence bothers him. “They’re mostly nocturnal hunters, so it’s tough sleeping at night,” Swickard said. “You wonder if they’re in the middle of your livestock, and we’re charged with the husbandry and care of those animals.” Area livestock producers feel their hands are tied if wolf numbers continue growing. Federal and state laws prohibit lethal recourse against wolves. Plus California lacks robust deer and elk populations such as those in Oregon and Idaho, so ranchers think their herds will be the top option on the wolves’ menu. “The wolves have to eat,” the rancher Daren Hagata said. “If they don’t have the wildlife populations … they’re going to come after your livestock.” “Once [wolves] get in and start harassing the cows, especially on a regular basis, weight gains go away, conception rates go down,” said another rancher, Jack Hanson. “That’d be my biggest worry, even more than the mortality issue.” With lethal action off the table – at least legally – ranchers are slowly coming to the realization they must try other methods. Owens spends a good deal of time meeting with ranchers in the area to educate them about Working Circle services. Despite work that might be seen as advocacy for wolves, Owens is ambivalent about their presence. Her efforts are grounded as much as anything in the realization that wolves are not going anywhere. “You like wolves, just like any other wildlife,” she said. “But when you see confirmation of pups, you get that sinking feeling. How’s this going to go? How many cows are we going to lose? How many wolves are we going to lose?” For examples of the methods Owens preaches, ranchers in the Lassen pack’s orbit could look north. Since 2016, Scott Sumner has served as a Working Circle-funded range steward for the Hart Ranch, which his sister, Susan Hart, owns. Sumner patrols Hart’s summer grazing meadows by foot and mountain bike, accompanied by his nine-month-old collie, Rachel. Sumner’s job was an urgent addition – in 2015, the Shasta pack became the state’s first wolf pack in nearly a century, and the Hart Ranch was squarely in its range. “My job is to know this landscape better than the cows and wolves,” Sumner said. “If I notice a change in the cows’ behavior, my radar goes up.” He keeps the cattle bunched tightly, rotates them between meadows, and is constantly seeking to minimize threats by, for example, thinning trees near salt licks to reduce odds of a wolf ambush. He checks a network of 14 trail cameras in the area, one of which snapped a photo this summer of OR-44, one of two lone wolves ranging through California. Since Sumner began range riding, the Harts have suffered no wolf depredations, and the pack appears to have disappeared, though the state hasn’t confirmed whether the wolves dispersed on their own or were poached. No other pack has established itself. “Who knows?” Sumner said. “Maybe there are no wolves here because I’m around.” Sumner understands the cattle he watches over would be at risk if wolves returned, but that doesn’t mean he’d be disappointed to see another pack. Shortly before the state confirmed the Shasta pack’s existence, a wolf trotted ahead of Sumner’s pickup, not 20 meters away, as he was driving near the ranch’s grazing meadows. “When I first saw it, it was pretty much just surprise – that’s a damn wolf! I was excited for 24 hours,” he said. I asked Sumner how seeing the wolf made him feel, and it took him some time to elaborate. Earlier in the day, he had lamented how some wolf advocates glorified the species. But when describing his emotions when he saw the wolf three years ago, reverence crept into his tone. “I don’t want to sound like a wolf-hugger,” he said, chuckling. “But they do symbolize a part of this country that I don’t want to see ever lost. I understand why they’re revered, and why they’re hated. I want to do what I can do, in what little time that I have, to help them be here.” This story was co-published with Pacific Standard, an editorial partner site.

      "Text: In 2010, air pollution scientists from three of Europe’s biggest cities – Paris, Berlin and London – sat down together. Our data showed a new and consistent pattern. Air pollution from wood burning had returned to our cities. Biomass energy schemes were subsidising new wood burners in schools and offices and wood was being burned in power stations, too, but the additional air pollution in our cities was coming from homes. We wrote a paper warning that biomass subsidies to reduce climate emissions may be leading to increased acceptability and popularity of home wood burning in stoves and fireplaces too. By 2016, home wood burning was the second-largest source of particle pollution emitted in London. By 2018, it was responsible for nearly half the emissions across Europe. Now an Australian study has calculated the health cost of home wood burning. It took place in Armidale, a city of about 25,000 people, midway between Sydney and Brisbane, known for its two cathedrals and elegant 19th-century buildings. Frosty nights are a feature of winter here and these are frequently polluted by the 40% of homes that use wood heaters. Researchers estimated that the air pollution from wood heating was responsible for up to 14 early deaths each year, an annual health cost of between A$5,000 and A$11,000 for each wood-burning home(about £3,000-6,000). A similar study in Tasmania valued the annual health harm at about A$4,200 for every wood-burning home. The problem is solvable. Stopping burning wood works for health. An earlier programme in Launceston, Tasmania, incentivised homeowners to switch from wood heating. It reduced wintertime respiratory deaths by 28% and heart deaths by 20%. Prof Fay Johnston at the University of Tasmania, who was involved in the Armidale and Launceston studies, said: “Wood heaters really punch above their weight when it comes to polluting the atmosphere. Any scheme that replaces wood heaters with less polluting forms of heating will pay for itself within a year and provide ongoing savings from the avoided additional disease and death associated with woodsmoke.” On the eve of Cop26, research from Chatham House has provided more evidence that the UK’s subsidised large-scale burning of wood for energy, such as wood chips burned at Drax power station, results in more carbon dioxide in our air, not less, for decades to come. If the government and homeowners had spent the past 10 years investing in insulation and non-combustion renewables, instead of wood burning, we would have healthier air in our cities today and less carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.\n",

      "Text: All eyes are on Cop26 in Glasgow since the climate crisis aroused worldwide attention and compelled more than 120 countries to join the unprecedented global Race to Zero carbon-emissions campaign. But the UN biodiversity conference in Kunming, or Cop15, should not be overshadowed, as biodiversity loss is an equally grave threat to humanity. Cop15, delayed repeatedly by the Covid-19 pandemic, will take place in two parts, online from 11 October, with more detailed discussions left for April’s meeting in Kunming, China. The conference will convene governments from around the world to agree new goals for nature for the next decade, as global biodiversity losses pose a threat to human wellbeing, affecting food, health and security, and increasing the likelihood of pandemics. Humanity has achieved unprecedented development and prosperity over the past 50 years, with the world population more than doubling and global GDP growing from barely $3tn in 1970 to nearly $85tn in 2020. But in this time nature has suffered enormous losses, with the global populations of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish declining by two-thirds on average, according to last year’s Living Planet report. We should not take biodiversity for granted from a human development perspective either. About 75% of crops depend on pollinators; approximately 75% of our fresh water comes from healthy forests; and more than half of the global population depends on nature for their livelihoods. When the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services concluded in 2019 that among the world’s 8 million species, 1 million of them were threatened with extinction in the next few decades, it served as a wake-up call. While conservationists hope an ambitious global biodiversity framework can be crafted in Kunming, it is necessary to recall the lessons of Cop10 in Japan, which agreed the 20 Aichi biodiversity targets to stem the destruction of wildlife and ecosystems. More than a decade later, the world has failed to reach even one of those targets. In a more complex context of global pandemic and climate challenges, the tension between development and conservation is even more pronounced. Without sufficient attention, even if such an ambitious plan were put down on paper in Kunming, it may share the fate of the Aichi targets. So, first and foremost, governments and societies must recognise that humanity and nature are one community with a shared future. Then we must properly value all products and services provided by biodiversity and the planet’s ecosystems. When all eyes are on the climate crisis, we must not forget nature’s vital role in climate mitigation, resilience and adaptation. As healthy ecosystems, including forests, wetlands, seas and grasslands, have served as enormous carbon sinks and helped mitigate climate change, a better way is to coordinate the two Cop processes for a synergised solution. Despite the challenges, we see hopeful signs that the importance of biodiversity is being acknowledged and that innovative conservation solutions are being developed in different parts of the world. Costa Rica is well known for its pioneering work in restoring natural ecosystems and reviving rainforests. As the host country of Cop15, China has held up eco-civilisation as one of its fundamental socio-economic development principles. It has designated 25% of its land and territorial waters as “ecological red-line” zones and curbed the trend of eco-degradation through concrete measures such as a logging ban, returning farmland to forest and grassland, establishing national parks, controlling water pollution and a ban on fishing in the Yangtze basin. Information technologies could serve as a gamechanger in building awareness and sharing knowledge. Global Forest Watch provides real-time mapping data for monitoring the world’s forests and unsustainable practices. Our organisation, the Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs (IPE), is working with partners to depict China’s red-line ecological zones on our Blue Map website and apps, side by side with local air and water-quality data, and the geolocation and environmental performances of 5m companies. Over the next 10 years, we hope to see biodiversity knowledge and best conservation practices pooled to better coordinate the protection of nature with pollution control and climate actions, and to help mobilise public supervision, strengthen government regulations and enable green supply chain and responsible investment and financing. Only such broad-based actions may bring about a transformation in society’s understanding of and relationship with biodiversity and ensure that, by 2050, the shared vision of living in harmony with nature can be fulfilled.

      "Text: Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer, has plans to become 100% powered by renewable and low-carbon forms of energy, according to an influential member of the royal family. But the process is likely to take decades, and some observers are sceptical as to whether it is any more than window-dressing. Prince Turki Al Faisal Al Saud, founder of the King Faisal Foundation and one of the state's top spokesmen, told the Global Economic Symposium in Brazil that he hoped the kingdom might be powered entirely by low-carbon energy within his lifetime – he is 67 – but that he thought it was likely to take longer. However, he insisted Saudi was moving ahead with investment in renewable energy, nuclear power and other alternatives to fossil fuels and that it could use its vast oil reserves for other goods, such as plastics and polymers. \"Oil is more precious for us underground than as a fuel source,\" he said. \"If we can get to the point where we can replace fossil fuels and use oil to produce other products that are useful, that would be very good for the world. I wish that may be in my lifetime, but I don't think it will be.\" Joss Garman, political director of Greenpeace, said: \"It speaks volumes that a Saudi prince can see the benefits of switching to clean energy sources when [UK chancellor] George Osborne seemingly cannot, but Saudi Arabia will only truly be a green economy when it leaves its fossil fuels in the ground.\" Saudi Arabia's energy use is almost entirely from fossil fuels at present, with about two-thirds coming from oil and the remainder from gas. The state produces close to 12m barrels of oil a day, representing more than 12% of world crude production, and has about one-fifth of the world's oil reserves, according to the US government's Energy Information Administration. Energy use per person within the kingdom is also high by world standards, because energy prices are kept so low. As Prince Turki noted, however, the kingdom has vast potential for using solar power. \"The cost of solar energy is now 15% of what it was 20 years ago,\" he noted. Saudi Arabia has also signed memoranda of understanding – though no final deal as yet – with Argentina over nuclear energy. But despite his commitment to advancing renewable energy in the Middle East, Prince Turki – who served as director of Saudi Arabia's intelligence services for more than 20 years and has also been an ambassador to the UK and the US – was also clear that the rest of the world was likely to continue to rely on fossil fuels for many years to come. \"No country can ban itself from any one form of energy,\" he said. One of the other potentially important technologies for Saudi Arabia is carbon capture and storage, as depleted oil fields could be used as storage for compressed carbon dioxide, but it has so far made little progress. The prince said the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology should be seen as an international effort rather than the responsibility of single countries. Nebjsa Nakicenovic, deputy chief of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, said CCS was likely to be a vital technology around the world. Though he acknowledged there could be problems, as the technology is still unproven, he warned: \"Do not discount CCS.\" On renewables, Nakicenovic said the world should aim to generate 30% of energy from sustainable renewable sources by 2030. That would represent more than a doubling of current renewable energy usage, because although on paper about 15% of energy now comes from renewable sources, this includes a large amount of biomass – mostly wood, dung and other waste – burned in developing countries. Much of this is unsustainable, and requires a significant use of resources in foraging for firewood. \"So [the target] is very ambitious, but doable,\" he said.\n",

      "Text: In the remote hills of Cumbria, a few miles north of Hadrian’s wall, three nondescript terrace houses stand side by side, quietly offering a glimpse of a low-carbon future. The houses are intentionally unremarkable in every way but one: they are the first in the UK to run on a blend of clean-burning hydrogen as part of the most sophisticated hydrogen testing facility in the world. Welcome to Hystreet. Engineers at the five-hectare site are testing whether hydrogen can safely replace the fossil-fuel gas pumped through transmission pipes and local grid networks into British homes as part of the government’s efforts to meet climate targets. “Ninety-nine percent of people don’t think about where their gas comes from, or how it gets there,” says Antony Green, National Grid’s hydrogen tsar and head of the FutureGrid project. His task is to create a realistic replica of the UK’s gas system to test whether the same pipelines that have carried gas from the North Sea into homes since the 1970s could transport low-carbon hydrogen in the future. Heating British homes accounts for 15% of the country’s total emissions, meaning a low-carbon alternative will be crucial to cut emissions to net zero by 2050. But the testing site is also key to understanding how hydrogen can be transported to major factories and industrial clusters to help tackle emissions from polluting factories and power plants. “The evidence we have built over the last few years shows that we can do this,” Green says, walking along the length of a giant gas pipe. “It’s all very well and good doing the paperwork. But you still need to prove it.” Green is interrupted briefly by a short alarm followed by a deep boom as a controlled explosion takes place just a mile or two away. The hydrogen testing site is located deep inside the country’s largest Royal Air Force base, where the occasional explosion is to be expected. There won’t be any at the hydrogen testing site, he assures me. Still, its location is a sensible precaution given the challenge ahead. Using the UK’s existing gas infrastructure to carry hydrogen is no simple task. It is more combustible than the traditional methane-rich gas we have learned to use safely in our homes, and its smaller molecules mean it is three times more likely to leak from pipelines or into homes than fossil gas. On the plus side, hydrogen is also lighter, meaning it is more likely to dissipate than to pool and create a combustion threat. A hydrogen future requires painstaking safety assessments, but also vast amounts of the fuel. Low-carbon hydrogen can be made in two ways: blue hydrogen can be extracted from fossil gas using carbon capture technology to trap the climate emissions which are released; green hydrogen can be made by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity. Although blue hydrogen is widely considered “low-carbon”, it has failed to win favour among climate campaigners. Despite using carbon-capture technology to trap emissions from the process, about 10% to 15% of the CO2 in the fossil gas would find its way to the atmosphere. It would also require continuing offshore gas production, which carries a hefty carbon footprint. Many would prefer a focus on green hydrogen, although questions remain over how soon it could play a meaningful role in cutting emissions and whether there would be enough renewable energy to fuel a hydrogen boom as well as the electrification of homes and transport. At the “beach to boiler” testing facility in Cumbria, Green makes use of disused bits of gas pipeline and valves to create a closed-loop system. The pipes range from the giant gas-import type found at the coast and across the country, to the smaller pipeline grids that crisscross local neighbourhoods, running for a total of about a kilometre before arriving at Hystreet’s carefully constructed test homes. The engineers test a blend of gas with 2% hydrogen before building up to 20% hydrogen, and then running pure hydrogen through the pipes to assess their safety. “We regularly have calls from all over the world to ask about what we’re doing here, and how we’re doing it,” Green adds. On Hystreet, each two-storey home uses a slightly different layout and construction type to represent typical residences found across the UK. They are allowed to slowly fill with hydrogen while indoor sensors monitor gas levels. When the safety limit is reached, automated hinges on doors and windows fly open to allow the gas to escape. “No explosions from us, though,” Green jokes. Inside, the appliances appear reassuringly underwhelming: a seemingly standard gas hob, an unremarkable boiler. Like natural gas, hydrogen is odourless, so would have the same distinctive smell added to help people quickly notice a leak. When it burns, it is hard to see in daylight, so the hob has an adjustment that produces a visible flame, similar to that of a traditional gas hob but redder in colour. “I think people expect something more, or something different,” says Green, as we peer into the cupboard at the boiler. “But this is the point, really. Running your home on hydrogen shouldn’t feel any different to natural gas.” Still, there are many who would rather homes didn’t run on hydrogen at all. For the sceptics, the challenge of overhauling the UK’s 4,000 miles of underground gas pipelines is too costly a step when heating and cooking could run on a low-carbon electricity system instead. The opposing factions in the debate run along predictable industry lines. National Grid and other companies that operate legacy gas infrastructure or gas production projects tend to favour home hydrogen, to prolong the life of existing assets. Energy companies that invest in low-carbon electricity generation tend to back electric heat pumps as the future for low-carbon homes. Last week, the government gave the green light to grants worth £5,000 to help homes upgrade to heat pumps, and said hydrogen trials would need to continue before a decision on home hydrogen would be made in 2026. Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, a major renewable energy investor and a home energy supplier, said: “It’s never going to happen. It’s a non-starter. The cost of re-engineering all the infrastructure, re-engineering all the boilers, and the inefficiency of turning hydrogen from a renewable source into a heating product for a domestic home is just not going to work.” His company is still enthusiastic about green hydrogen – but has its sights set far from homes. “We’re going to continue to focus on hydrogen for transport, which is too difficult to electrify, and for industrial processes because we think that’s where the biggest difference can be made,” Anderson said. However the future for the UK’s hydrogen ambitions pans out, the lessons learned in Cumbria will play a crucial role in making them a reality.\n",

      "Text: Sweden is one step closer to making the use of methane-reducing cow feed additives such as seaweed government policy after experts recommended further investigation into the area. A report by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency into reduced methane emissions says development in the field has been “rapid in recent years” and is among “a number of new interesting additives with higher potential”. Among the cow feed additives cited in the report were the seaweed red algae and the chemical 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP). According to manufacturers, the daily feeding of red algae (where the active substance is bromoform) can reduce the methane emissions of meat animals by up to 90%. But, the agency said, more knowledge on cultivation and use was needed. 3-NOP, which has been fed to several cattle categories in Sweden and elsewhere, has been approved for use in dairy cows in the EU since February 2022. The chemical can cut methane emissions by an average of about 30% in dairy cows, according to the report, and by 45% in meat cattle. The discovery about the effects of feeding seaweed was originally made by researchers in Australia and works by preventing microorganisms in the cow’s first stomach from producing methane. While some feed additives “appear to have significant potential”, it warns that there is still uncertainty over the long-term effects and factors preventing it from being used more within production systems. “More research and analysis is required both in terms of today’s marketed products and to develop alternative, future feed additives,” says the report. As a result of its findings, the study proposes that the government commission the agency, along with other authorities, to further investigate the area. Lines of inquiry, it says, should include socioeconomic impact, support for farmers and other stages in the food chain, improved research, innovation initiatives and increased collaboration with the industry. Other potential areas of investigation for “climate-smart cows”, it says, are enhancing productivity and genetic variations between breeds on how much methane they produce. In 2021, Sweden’s agricultural sector produced 3.6m tonnes of CO2 equivalents of methane – 2.9m tonnes of which were produced by cattle digestion. Emma Carlen, a climate analyst at the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, said: “We believe that this [methane-reducing feed additives] can be a measure to reduce the methane from cattle in Sweden. We don’t have very many other measures that can have this affect within current production level. But we also believe it’s still quite new and there’s still more research to be done before we can really come in with a clear policy measure.” The extra cost of such measures was a big constraint for farmers, she said, which is why they wanted to look at what financial support might be needed, as well as other measures. Fredrik Åkerman, the co-founder and CEO of Volta Greentech, which is developing a land-based seaweed factory on the west coast of Sweden to make cattle feed, said in its pilot projects across two Swedish farms so far it had reduced cows’ methane emissions by 80% a day. Next year, the company, which started five years ago, is planning another pilot project at a commercial beef farm in the UK. “We have developed a strategy that makes cows burp and fart less methane emissions,” he said. “So the additive is included into the cow feed and we have now been able, in several commercial pilot projects, to reduce 80% of emissions per day that the cows emit, which is of course making a big positive impact on climate change and agriculture.” By installing a sensor on the farm, they are able to measure methane emissions before and after the introduction of the feed, data which is then verified by a third party. The report’s recommendations are vital for the industry’s development, said Åkerman. “To maintain profitability in the industry, it’s quite difficult for us to sell a product that costs money to reduce emissions if the incentives are not there. So the policy development is very important,” he added. “It has been lagging behind other industries.\n",

      "Text: The industry standards body for renewable energy installers is calling on the government to immediately rectify the failure to pay businesses for work on the green homes grant, which is leading, according to some companies, to rising debts and job losses. Installers of renewable energy systems have been left unpaid for several months by the government, the Guardian reported this week, while long delays were putting members of the public off the scheme. Ian Rippin, who leads the Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS), said he had since spoken to the government about the “numerous issues” that have come to light relating to the flagship £2bn green homes grant. The grants are intended to help the UK move to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 by providing financial help for householders to switch from fossil fuel systems to renewable energy. The grants – of £5,000 and £10,000 – also cover the installation of insulation to make homes more energy efficient. The government has promised that 600,000 householders will be helped to make their homes less carbon intensive. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said four months after the scheme was set up, it had given approximately 25% of householders who had applied approval to carry out work. But installers who spoke to the Guardian said they would not be doing any more work until they were paid the tens of thousands of pounds owed by the government dating back to last autumn. The contract to run the grants was awarded to a large American global consulting firm ICF. Details of the contract amount have not been published. Rippin, who runs the organisation which sets industry standards for renewable energy providers, said he was talking to the government about overcoming many issues. He said he wanted the MCS to become more involved in the administration of the grants after installers complained of delays, inefficient communication and a lack of expert knowledge. Rippin said: “We welcomed the green homes grant, and remain committed to it, though we are firm in our demand that the ongoing issues around payments need rectifying immediately. “As the standards organisation for domestic renewables, we fully understand the cost – in both time and money – of domestic renewable installations and feel the extreme frustration that the industry is experiencing at this time.” Rippin said MCS was acting as an adviser to the government for the scheme. He said he was calling for more openness around the way the green homes grants were being run. He said: “We have reiterated our call for more transparency in how the scheme is administered and for greater efficiencies in terms of releasing installer payments. “The role of MCS is to protect installers and consumers by upholding rigorous industry standards. In doing so, we are fully invested in protecting our certified installers’ interests.” One installer of spray foam insulation, who did not want to be named, said the government owed him £68,000 and despite speaking every day to the grant call centre he had still not been paid for the work. He said: “They are ruining my business. I am technically insolvent now, and I have had to lay people off and shut one of my branches.” ICF has not responded to requests for a comment. A BEIS spokesperson said: “Ministers have asked the scheme administrator to pay money owed to installers as a matter of urgency. “Over 18,000 Green Homes Grant vouchers have already been issued, with more going out every day, helping us improve the energy efficiency of homes, as we build back greener from the Covid-19 pandemic. We also continue to work with customers and installers to ensure they are clear on the information and checks required, so that vouchers can be paid as quickly as possible.”\n",

      "Text: Sales of electric vehicles in Australia tripled in 2019 despite a lack of government support, according to the industry’s peak body. The country’s network of electric vehicle charging stations was also growing, the Electric Vehicle Council’s annual report found, including a rise in the number of faster charging stations that let drivers recharge a car in about 15 minutes. But the report, released on Wednesday, found the market share for electric vehicles was still only 0.6% of new vehicle sales – well behind the 2.5% to 5% in other developed countries. The chief executive of the council, Behyad Jafari, said the rise in sales was down to more models becoming available. There are now 28 electric models on sale, with eight priced below $65,000. Six more were due to arrive before the end of 2021, including two priced below $50,000, the council’s report said. Jafari told Guardian Australia: “A big challenge for Australia is that every other developed country has vehicle standards and EV policies in place. “We have repeatedly heard from car companies that they were planning to bring vehicles here, but Australia doesn’t have that policy support.” The Morrison government promised a national electric vehicle strategy would be finalised by the middle of this year, but the policy has been delayed. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, last year accused Labor of wanting to “end the weekend” and force people out of four-wheel drives after the opposition set a target of 50% of new car sales being electric by 2030. Jafari cited the Kia e-Niro – an award-winning electric SUV that was being prepared for an Australian launch, but is now reportedly on hold because the manufacturer favoured shipping to countries with emissions standards. The council’s members include BMW, Nissan, Hyundai and Harley Davidson, as well as energy, technology and charging infrastructure companies. Sales of electric vehicles – which include plug-in hybrids – went from 2,216 in 2018 to 6,718 in 2019, the report said. Jafari said about 80% of those sales were all-electric vehicles. There have been 3,226 electric vehicles sold in 2020, the report said, despite an overall drop of 20% in vehicle sales due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Jafari said: “Our report is showing that Australian consumers want these cars. “There is no controversy that the future of the industry is electric, but at the moment the industry is looking at different markets. We want policies that show [Australia] is going on this journey.” Government agency data has forecast that half the new cars sold will be electric by 2035 even if there is no policy to support their uptake. Manufacturers currently selling electric cars in Australia are Nissan, Hyundai, Mitsubishi, Tesla, Volvo, Porsche, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Jaguar and Renault, the report said. Jafari said most G20 countries had emissions standards in place for vehicles sold and incentives in place to support electric vehicles, such as rebates or exemptions from charges. This hadn’t happened in Australia, he said. The report said: “Globally, carmakers are rolling out more electric vehicle models, but so far production cannot keep up with demand. This means that without policy signals, Australians will continue to be denied access to the full global range of electric vehicles.” On Tuesday, one Australian charging provider, Evie Networks, opened an ultra-fast station at a rest stop at Campbell Town in Tasmania – between Launceston and Hobart. The company said the station would connect EV owners in the state’s north and south and the two 350kW chargers could recharge a vehicle in 15 minutes. Two more sites were planned for Tasmania, the company said. A Tasmanian government grant to support electric vehicle charging had helped finance the site. Evie was also supported with a $15m grant from the federal government’s Australian Renewable Energy Agency. According to the council report, Australia now has 2,307 public charging stations, including 357 fast chargers – a rise of 40% in the past year. A survey of 2,900 people in New South Wales, the ACT, Victoria and South Australia, carried out by NRMA, RACV and RAA on behalf of the council, found the main barriers to buying an electric vehicle were concerns over access to charging points, cost and uncertainty over driving range. Consumers favoured electric vehicles because of their environmental footprint, lower maintenance costs and vehicle performance. The report said the average battery range of electric vehicles available in Australia was 400km, but almost 80% of people thought the average was less. According to the survey, 56% of Australians would consider an electric car when they next bought a vehicle. “We are far behind, but it is surmountable,” Jafari said. The council report also rated state and territories on the policies that supported its industry and found the ACT was leading, followed by NSW and Queensland. A review of commercial electric vehicle use found public electric bus trials were planned or under way in Queensland, NSW, WA, Victoria and ACT. There are now more than 400,000 electric buses in use around the globe.\n",

      "Text: The Trump administration on Wednesday eased rules for handling toxic coal ash from more than 400 US coal-fired power plants after utilities pushed back against regulations adopted under Barack Obama. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) acting administrator, Andrew Wheeler, said the changes would save utilities roughly $30m annually. The move represents the latest action by Donald Trump’s EPA to boost the struggling coal industry by rolling back environmental and public health protections enacted under his predecessor. It pushes back the deadline to close problematic ash dumps and gives state regulators flexibility in how they deal with the vast waste piles that result from burning coal for electricity. Environmentalists argued the administration was endangering the health of people living near power plants and ash storage sites, while industry representatives welcomed the announcement. US coal plants produce about 100m tons annually of ash and other waste, much of which ends up in unlined disposal ponds prone to leak. Some have been in use for decades. Data released by utilities in March under an EPA mandate showed widespread evidence of groundwater contamination at coal plants. Heightened levels of pollutants, including arsenic and radium in some cases, were documented at plants in numerous states, from Virginia to Alaska. EPA documents show most savings for utilities from the new rules will come from extending by 18 months the deadline to close ash dumps that don’t meet water protection standards. The new deadline is 31 October 2020. The utility industry said the change provided “regulatory certainty” for ash dump operators. That’s in part because it aligns the closure requirements with forthcoming guidelines limiting the levels of toxic metals in wastewater discharged from power plants. The changes also give state regulators the power to suspend monitoring requirements for dumps that don’t meet water quality standards. “It’s not like EPA has granted us a free pass here. It just gives us additional time to operate those facilities and better synch them up” with the coming wastewater guidelines, said James Roewer, executive director of the Utility Solid Waste Advisory Group, an industry organization that had pushed for the changes. The original, Obama-era rule, adopted in 2015, came in response to a huge 2008 coal ash spill in Kingston, Tennessee. A containment dike burst at a Tennessee Valley Authority power plant and released 5.4m cubic yards of ash. The accident dumped waste into two nearby rivers, destroyed homes and brought national attention to the issue. The attorney Larissa Liebmann, with the Waterkeeper Alliance, said the costs saved by utilities would not simply go away. Instead, she said, they would be borne by communities that are forced to deal with contaminated water. “We think it’s fundamentally unfair,” Liebmann said. “The rules that were created in 2015 were already very much to the bare minimum.”\n",

      "Text: Gas stoves are making people sick, contributing pollution that makes indoor air up to two to five times dirtier than outdoor air, according to a new report. Despite the risks, regulators have failed to set standards for indoor air quality – a problem that is now likely to be exacerbated by large numbers of people spending time inside and cooking at home during the coronavirus pandemic. Fossil-fuel-burning stoves are likely exposing tens of millions of Americans to air pollution levels that would be illegal if they were outside, concludes the review of decades of science by the Rocky Mountain Institute and multiple environmental advocacy groups. Lead report author Brady Seals said little attention has been paid despite longstanding knowledge of the problem. “Somehow we’ve gotten accustomed to having a combustion device, often unvented, inside of the home,” Seals said. About a third of US households cook primarily with gas – which emits nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide, in addition to the particle pollution that all types of stoves produce. Older, poorly maintained stoves pollute even more including risks from carbon monoxide. Even small increases in short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide can increase asthma risks for children. One analysis found that children in homes with gas stoves have a 42% higher chance of having asthma symptoms. Another in Australia attributed 12.3% of all childhood asthma burden to gas stoves. Nitrogen dioxide also makes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease worse and may be linked to heart problems, diabetes and cancer. Carbon monoxide poisoning can cause a headache, nausea, a rapid heartbeat, cardiac arrest and death. The best solution, according to the report, is to change to electric stoves. But individuals with gas stoves can also open windows, cook on their back burners, use an exhaust hood, run an air purifier with a HEPA filter and install a carbon monoxide detector. Indoor air pollution hits poor Americans and people of color worse because they are often also exposed to lead, mercury, highways and industrial plants, said Dr Robert Gould, a California pathologist and board member for Physicians for Social Responsibility who peer-reviewed the report. “We just need to make these investments,” Gould said. “This fits into an overall plan we would have to protect, particularly, our vulnerable populations.”\n",

      "Text: Britain is coming under increasing pressure to provide Ukraine with an extra €50m (£43m) to construct a new contamination shield over the top of the stricken Chernobyl nuclear plant before the old one collapses. Officials from the European commission said governments around the world were being urged to find €750m to help build a more sophisticated roof over the burnt-out reactor and storage for 200 tonnes of highly radioactive fuel. Jean-Paul Joulia, from the commission's nuclear safety unit, admitted the cost of just this aspect of the Chernobyl clean-up was running at €1.5bn – double the original estimate – partly due to \"some delays\" to some projects. But he said he was confident that foreign governments would stump up the money needed for the shield, even in today's financially difficult climate. \"I am optimistic the international community is committed to this. It is important for a number of reasons,\" he said. The disaster at Chernobyl, on 26 April 1986, is recognised as the world's worst nuclear accident. One of the power station's reactors exploded and the subsequent fire spewed a radioactive cloud across Europe. The accident claimed the lives directly of at least 50 people, mainly fire crews and nuclear workers who tried to fight the fire on the fateful night. Radioactive fallout is believed to have caused many other deaths from thyroid cancer and related illnesses, with an eventual death toll estimated at anywhere between 4,000 and 200,000. The disaster also triggered the relocation of tens of thousands of local people, some of whom have never been allowed back to the contaminated towns. The accident and its aftermath have resonance currently as new nuclear plants are being planned in Britain and other parts of Europe. Nuclear power was heavily discredited for some time after Chernobyl because the accident pointed to the enormous dangers associated with it. Ukraine and foreign contributors have already spent more than €750m trying to make safe the nuclear plant. The UK has so far provided €53.1m to help build the new shield and is under pressure to stump up a further €50m, although Ukrainian sources said no money had yet been promised. With the 25th anniversary approaching, the European commission is encouraging governments to make public new cash commitments in advance of a \"pledging\" conference scheduled for one week before the April anniversary. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which has been overseeing the spending of the money at Chernobyl, admitted squeezing out more money at this time was a \"big challenge\". Vince Novak, a director of the nuclear safety department of the EBRD in London, said the design life of the temporary shield thrown up by the-then Soviet Union in the immediate aftermath of the accident in 1986 \"runs out\" in 2016. A new moveable barrier would be one of the world's biggest engineering feats due to its size and innovative features. The work will be done by a consortium involving Bechtel, the US firm which has worked on the London Underground and the Channel tunnel. The current shield has been propped up by a series of new steel columns but experts working on the project accept that the structure is barely adequate and needs replacing as quickly as possible. The barrier is sitting over the top of what remains of a deeply radioactive reactor core, but also covers the vast bulk of the fuel from the plant which has seeped into the concrete floor. A new permanent shield would prevent rain from getting into the old plant but also allow more work to be carried out on dismantling the remains of the equipment and the fuel without creating more escapes of hazardous dust and particles. Nuclear workers in Sweden were the first to detect the radioactive material that was thrown into the atmosphere from Chernobyl. The fallout from the accident in the early hours of 26 April 1986 crossed over Europe, and deposited the radioactive isotope caesium-137 in mainly upland areas of Wales, Scotland and England. The disaster, which released at least 100 times more radiation than the atom bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, forced the government to put 9,700 farms and 4.2 million sheep under restriction across the UK. Restrictions were lifted in Northern Ireland in 2000. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs confirmed yesterday that the last time the government updated the public on the restrictions was in 2009 when the then health minister Dawn Primarolo revealed 369 farms and 190,000 sheep were still affected. Of those farms, 355 are in north Wales, with nine in Cumbria and seven in Scotland. Farmers in these areas must have their livestock scanned before they are able to move them.\n",

      "Text: Mining companies will receive more than twice as much in fuel tax credits as the Turnbull government will spend on environment and biodiversity programs this financial year, an analysis has found. Coalmining companies alone are expected to get more back than the diminishing funding allocated to the federal environment department. The analysis by the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) found that, across commonwealth, state and territory governments, investment in environment and biodiversity programs was cut by 9% – from $6.95bn to $6.32bn – in the three years to 2016-17. Total budget spending rose by 10% in the same period, from $634.9bn to $701.5bn. It adds to a weight of evidence that environment campaigners and political veterans say shows government support for environment protection is at its lowest ebb since before the landmark decisions to protect Kakadu, the Daintree rainforest and the Franklin river in the 1980s. ACF economist Matt Rose said it was distressing that public investment in the environment was being slashed while government budgets were rapidly growing. “It shows that our elected representatives have made a clear decision to devalue our natural world and safe climate at a time when they are under enormous strain,” he said. “It robs people of the funding needed to make a practical difference for our environment through programs like land restoration, tree planting and removing invasive species.” An initial ACF analysis released in December found the federal environment department budget was slashed by 30% over the past three complete financial years, with further cuts planned out to 2020-21. A new paper by the same group says that while the federal environment department’s budget had been cut to a projected $950m, the commonwealth is expected to award the mining sector $2.5bn in fuel tax credits this year. An estimated $980m of that would go to coal companies. Under legislation introduced in 2006, some businesses are able to claim the cost of the excise paid on various fuels (40.1 cents a litre for liquid fuels such as diesel) back as a credit against their tax. It has been justified on the grounds the excise is used to fund roads, and mining and agricultural businesses should not have to pay it for fuel used in off-road vehicles. Funding raised from the excise mostly goes into general budget revenue, which may or may not include roads. The policy has bipartisan support, but it has long been opposed by the Greens and environment groups. Rose said it meant some of the world’s biggest companies including BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Glencore paid no tax on the fuel they used to extract and sell Australia’s minerals while environment and other departments endured deep cuts. The commonwealth’s state of the environment report last year found parts of Australia’s natural estate were in poor or deteriorating condition and there was insufficient public support for environmental management and restoration programs. Guardian Australia reported that the government considered removing the credit scheme, but the Coalition has generally agreed with the mining industry that the policy is a justified rebate on a business input, not a fossil fuel subsidy. The office of the environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, did not directly address a question for this story about the relative financial support for mining companies and the environment department. Federally, biodiversity funding and the long-running Landcare program to tackle land degradation are facing the biggest annual cuts. Landcare has had what was once $1bn funding over four years spread over six, equivalent to a 33% reduction. Tony Abbott’s long-promised $525m green army program was launched but is now being shut with less than half its budget spent. About $225m of green army funding was reclaimed as a budget saving, and $100m went back to Landcare under a deal with the Greens in return for their support for a backpacker tax. Frydenberg said the government was investing billions in Landcare, the emissions reduction fund that pays businesses and farmers to cut carbon dioxide emissions as well as protecting the Great Barrier Reef, which recently received an additional $60m, in part for research into making coral more resilient. “We are also developing smarter policies to galvanise more action for the environment,” he said. “For example, the Coalition’s threatened species strategy identifies those key species the government is seeking to prioritise for investment and calls on partners from other sectors to co-invest.” The ACF report finds the environment cuts in Canberra have coincided with a smaller reduction at state and territory level. Across the eight jurisdictions, environment spending was cut 5% over the past three years. That may be reversed if commitments for the current financial year are delivered. State and territory governments have promised to restore and increase environment funding to a level 5% higher than it was in 2013-14. Their total budget spending is growing even more rapidly, up by a projected 19% over the same period. The biggest cut has been in Victoria, where spending across three agencies was cut 10%, mainly due to the state Environment Protection Authority losing a third of its funding. Western Australia’s environment budget declined by 7%, though the new McGowan Labor government said it would boost it this year by about $10,000 to a level 4% lower than it was in 2013-14. The Northern Territory was the only jurisdiction to increase environmental spending as a proportion of its total budget since 2013. Queensland has increased environmental spending 10% since deep public service cuts by the Newman LNP government in 2013, but not at the rate at which it has been restored to other areas. New South Wales’ environment spending was flat over the three years while overall spending has grown 14%. Rose said while state investment in the environment had not been slashed to the extent of the national budget, there was a widening gap between the growth in total public spending and that dedicated to clean air, clean water and tackling climate change. He welcomed the fact the states were projected to reverse some environment cuts, but said experience showed budget projections were not always realised. “We need to reserve judgment until the greater investment is delivered,” he said. The ACF said the lack of a clear framework for environmental budget accounting complicated the process of working out what constituted environmental spending. Information used in the analysis was largely drawn from budget papers.\n",

      "Text: Northern Oman has just been battered by Cyclone Shaheen, the first tropical cyclone to make it that far west into the Gulf. Around Basra in southern Iraq this summer, pressure on the grid owing to 50C heat led to constant blackouts, with residents driving around in their cars to stay cool. Kuwait broke the record for the hottest day ever in 2016 at 53.6, and its 10-day rolling average this summer was equally sweltering. Flash floods occurred in Jeddah, and more recently Mecca, while across Saudi Arabia average temperatures have increased by 2%, and the maximum temperatures by 2.5%, all just since the 1980s. In Qatar, the country with the highest per capita carbon emissions in the world and the biggest producer of liquid gas, the outdoors is already being air conditioned. In Tehran, air pollution kills 4,000 people each year, while in the south-west province of Khuzestan citizens blocked roads and burned tyres to protest against droughts caused by a combination of mismanagement, western sanctions and killer heat. In the United Arab Emirates it is estimated that the climate crisis costs £6bn a year in higher health costs. The salinity of the Gulf, caused by proliferating desalination plants, has increased by 20%, with all the likely impact on marine life and biodiversity. And it is, of course, going to get much worse, as temperatures, humidity and waters rise. The Middle East is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world. By the end of the century, if the more dire predictions prove true, Mecca may not be habitable, making the summer Haj a pilgrimage of peril, even catastrophe. Large tracts of the Middle East will resemble the desert in Ethiopia’s Afar, a vast expanse with no permanent human settlement pressed against the Red Sea. The gleaming Gulf coastal cities by the end of the century could find themselves inundated as waters rise. It is not quite Apocalypse Now, but Apocalypse Foreseeably Soon. Jim Krane, an energy research analyst at Rice University Baker Institute in Houston, said: “It is a really tough issue because the interests of the ruling elites run contrary to the interests of citizens. The ruling elites are all dependent on oil rents for the survival of their regimes. They need the oil business to stay alive for them to stay in power. Their system is based on continued oil rent, but ultimately, the citizens’ long-term interests are with a liveable climate”. Zeina Khalil Hajj, a founder of Greenpeace in the Middle East, says that the region is under a double squeeze. “As demand for energy changes, a region that has been fundamentally reliant on fossil fuel, oil and carbon for its economic survival cannot continue with this dependence. There will be no market for their oil. But as its climate changes, it has an extra duty to shift for its own survival. Extreme weather is changing the lives of the people at a daily level. There is no choice, but to go green.” The west’s insatiable demand for fossil fuel has allowed this region to build car-dependent cities, full of shiny air-conditioned skyscrapers and malls. Now it has to find a way to avoid its self-destruction; this has to be, in Thomas Friedman’s phrase, the Middle East’s Promethean moment. In truth, the region has been told for at least a decade that it needs to make the transition out of oil. The precise point oil demand will peak has been contested, and depends on a myriad of assumptions about regulation, technology and consumer behaviour. But many people say demand will peak in about 2040, and then decline. But the International Energy Association’s report Net Zero by 2050, by contrast, proposed oil demand fall from 88m barrels a day (mb/d) in 2020, to 72 mb/d in 2030 and to 24 mb/d in 2050, a fall of almost 75% between 2020 and 2050. It argued that the Gulf has all three elements needed to switch to renewables: capital, sun and large tracts of vacant land. Until recently there were few signs that the petro-states, including Iran, felt the need to get out of fossil fuels at that kind of pace. Asked to comment on the IEA report, including its call for a cessation of new oil investments, the Saudi energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, famously described it as a sequel to La La Land. “If I had to be concerned with IEA projections,” Abdulaziz said in Abu Dhabi during a public forum at the 24th World Energy Congress in 2019, “I probably [would] be [on] Prozac all the time.” The Qatari energy minister, Saad al-Kaabi, said cutting off oil and gas production would cause damaging supply crunches, and laughed at “the euphoria around energy transition”. Opec’s own projections suggest oil demand will rise in absolute terms through to 2045, and oil’s share of world wide energy demand will fall only from 30% to 28%. Hardly a green revolution. And looking at the current energy crunch, spiralling price of oil and predicted demand for oil this year, the case for a fast transition is harder to make than a year ago. The Gulf States are still highly reliant on oil and gas exports, which remain more than 70% of total goods exports in Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman, and on oil revenues, which exceed 70% of total government revenues in Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain. In Vision 2030, published in 2016, the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, promised to turn the country into a diversified industrial power house. The reality is very different. The World Bank shows Saudi Arabia is still 75% dependent on oil exports for its budget. Aramco, the Saudi company with the largest carbon footprint in the world, is not trying to diversify at the rate of Shell or BP. Indeed, it has just announced an investment to increase crude capacity from 12m barrels a day to 13m barrels by 2027. Hajj says it may require a rapid psychological shift away from consumerism. “The Gulf is not even close to that kind of conversation. If you see the lifestyle in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, it is based on endless consumption. My fear is that we are so far away from it both in terms of policy and willingness”. Iran is now the seventh-largest carbon emitter per capita, the UAE the second largest and Saudi Arabia the 13th. Of course, the Gulf rulers at events such as Cop26 can fend off some criticism by arguing that the Gulf region is not itself collectively one of the great emitters, either now or historically. The region is responsible for only 4.7 % of worldwide carbon emissions, dwarfed by the pollution from Europe, America and China. The oil that the Middle East exports is logged against the carbon emissions of the users, not the producers. Yet the region’s leaders now appear to be responding to pressure to act not only from the west, but their own population. The goose has finally realised the golden egg – oil – is turning brown. Frank Wouters, director of the EU-GCC Clean Energy Network, says that although even a year ago preaching about the green deal was not exactly rewarding (“It felt a bit like going to the butcher shop and telling them you want to become a vegetarian”), attitudes are changing. The Gulf’s self-proclaimed first mover, the UAE, was the first country in the region to ratify the Paris agreement and is now the least dependent on oil for government revenues. Last week it announced a “net zero initiative by 2050” to be begun with $163bn (£118bn) of investments and a new minister for climate change and the environment, Mariam Almheiri. The announcement came after the UAE ordered an 80-day brainstorming session in every government department from June. It was the first petro-state to embrace net zero in domestic consumption. The plan is still in its infancy, and some of it is ill defined, but the direction is clear. It has promised to be 50% reliant on renewables and nuclear for its electricity by 2050. The Abu Dhabi national oil company has said it will source 100% of its grid power from nuclear and solar. Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum solar park is expected to be the largest lowest-cost single-site solar park in the world, with a planned production capacity of up to 5000MW. The price of solar coming out of the Middle East is also incredibly low. Gulf states are deeply competitive, so a flurry of news is emerging. Qatar has appointed a climate minister; Bahrain is targeting net zero by 2050; Kuwait has a new emissions plan. Saudi Arabia, which rarely likes to be outdone by the UAE, had already said it would increase its share of renewables in electricity generation from a trivial 0.3% to 50% by 2030, as well as plant 10bn trees in the coming decades. At the weekend the world’s largest oil producer staged an unprecedented Middle East Green Initiative Summit in Riyadh, an event that attracted broadly approving speeches from Prince Charles and John Kerry. It promised it would reach net zero carbon emissions within its borders by 2060, less ambitious than the request by Prince Charles to reach the target by 2050 with clear baselines. It also said it would reduce carbon emissions by 278m tonnes a year by 2030, more than double its previous target. Senior Saudis say they have been maestros at summits, websites and visions, but true credibility stems from turning PR concepts such as a circular carbon economy into a reality. Many in the west are sceptical. Fossil fuels shipped abroad are not on the Saudi’s carbon ledger, owing to UN accounting rules, and the promised internal reduction in emissions is dependent on a heavy bet that unproven blue hydrogen and carbon capture technology will work. Greenpeace Middle East suggested the summit was a fraud to please the US, as the Saudis’ plan included increasing oil production. Others say at least Saudi has felt the need to join – rather than stall – the climate debate. One reason the Gulf monarchies have been able to be so slow in weaning themselves off the commodity that made them rich is that the wealth has been used to numb public opinion. Citizens have been bought off through a mixture of no taxes, along with water, petrol and energy subsidies. The dynamic is different in Lebanon, Iraq and to a lesser extent Iran. But that is changing, and small green civil society groups are starting to emerge, such as Kesk, Nature Iraq and Greenpeace Middle East. The issue, according to Israel’s leftist vegan environment minister Tamar Zandberg, could transform some of the frozen inter-state politics of the Middle East for the better. Zandberg, who is working to get her own government to adopt net zero, says countries in the region have been very good at looking at the past. Climate change makes it essential they instead talk about a shared future. “We share the same problems, the same sun, the same lack of water, and the same collapse of our ecosystem. We need to share the solutions.” Support urgent, independent climate journalism Make a contribution from just £1 Become a digital subscriber and get something in return for your money\n",

      "Text: Boris Johnson is to put nuclear energy at the heart of the UK’s new energy strategy, but ministers have refused to set targets for onshore wind and vowed to continue the exploitation of North Sea oil and gas. Amid deep divisions among senior Conservatives, the strategy will enrage environmentalists, who say the government’s plans are in defiance of its own net-zero targets and neglect alternative measures that experts say would provide much quicker relief from high energy bills. The prime minister will launch the plan on Thursday, after a period of intense political wrangling set against the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has convulsed energy markets and sent home energy bills rocketing. Whitehall sources said rows over the strategy between No 10, the Treasury and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) continued right up until the eve of publication, with an insider describing the process as “chaos”. The cabinet eventually agreed that atomic energy would form the backbone of the strategy, and up to eight new reactors are planned. Targets for offshore wind and solar power generation will also be raised, in a push for 95% of Great Britain’s electricity to come from domestic low-carbon energy sources by 2030. But the plans risk infuriating environmental campaigners, after the opportunity to remove barriers to more onshore wind farms appeared to fall victim to Tory in-fighting, new North Sea drilling won the government’s blessing, and ministers appeared to open the door to fracking. Opposition parties were scathing about the strategy. Two former energy secretaries from Labour and the Liberal Democrats branded it “ludicrous” and “hopeless” for failing to expand onshore wind power or tackle energy efficiency. Ed Miliband, the Labour climate change secretary, said the energy relaunch was “in disarray” and would do nothing to help the millions of families facing an energy crisis now. “Boris Johnson has completely caved to his own backbenchers and now, ludicrously, his own energy strategy has failed on the sprint we needed on onshore wind and solar – the cheapest, cleanest forms of homegrown power,” he said. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader and another former energy secretary, added: “The Conservatives’ failure to help people cut their bills with an urgent energy insulation programme, the failure to back super-cheap onshore wind and the failure to back properly new technologies like tidal power and hydrogen is a total betrayal of families and pensioners across the UK.” The energy strategy outlines a wide-ranging plan to boost domestic energy production through a range of power sources. They include: Increasing nuclear capacity from 7 gigawatts to 24GW Offshore wind target raised from 40GW to 50GW (from 11GW today) Solar could grow five times from 14GW to 70GW by 2035 An “impartial” review into whether fracking is safe Up to 10GW of hydrogen power by 2030 Johnson said the plan will “reduce our dependence on power sources exposed to volatile international prices we cannot control, so we can enjoy greater energy self-sufficiency with cheaper bills”. “This plan comes in light of rising global energy prices, provoked by surging demand after the pandemic as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “This will be central to weaning Britain off expensive fossil fuels, which are subject to volatile gas prices set by international markets we are unable to control, and boosting our diverse sources of homegrown energy for greater energy security in the long term.” While some renewable domestic energy sources won backing, the wind industry’s hopes of getting the green light to double onshore capacity to 30GW appeared to have fallen victim to opposition from within the Conservative party to new projects, particularly in England. Communities who live near planned new projects could be offered incentives, such as guaranteed lower energy bills, but the plan does not include targets for increased generation. Cabinet colleagues have been at odds over whether to reform planning laws to spur faster development of onshore windfarms, which can take as little as a year to build and start contributing to the grid, but were described by transport secretary Grant Shapps as an “eyesore” at the weekend. Shapps and chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris, a longstanding opponent of onshore wind, are among a group of MPs who have sought to thwart a major rollout in England, with Michael Gove and business minister Kwasi Kwarteng – whose brief includes energy – among those to have pushed back. The business department is also understood to have been thwarted by the Treasury in a plan to channel £300m of budget underspend into a rapid rollout of energy efficiency upgrades that could aid homeowners in bringing down their bills. Solar won significant backing from the government, which said planning rules could be relaxed to favour development on non-protected land, enabling capacity to increase up to fivefold, from 14GW to 70GW. The target for hydrogen power will be doubled to 10GW by 2030 “subject to affordability and value for money”. Overall, “clean” energy sources could provide up to 40,000 new jobs, reaching a total of 480,000 by 2030, the government will say. But alongside the push for renewables sit plans that will alarm opponents of further oil and gas exploitation. The British Geological Survey will conduct an “impartial” review of whether fracking for shale gas can proceed safely, a move likely to spark fury among environmental campaigners about the controversial technology, particularly after a moratorium was imposed on the process in 2019. New North Sea oil and gas projects are also likely to be accelerated, although the strategy sets out proposals to limit emissions as much as possible. Nuclear power forms the centrepiece of the energy strategy. Ministers expect to begin a competitive selection process as early as next year for a new round of nuclear projects, although tensions between Downing Street and the Treasury over the cost of new projects, which are expected to require government investment, have yet to be resolved. The target of producing 25% of Britain’s electricity from atomic energy is likely to require tens of billions of pounds of new investment from private companies, with the state providing guarantees under a new “regulated asset base” funding model. A £120m “Future Nuclear Enabling Fund” will be launched this month in the hope of kickstarting projects, while a new body called Great British Nuclear will oversee the plans. National Grid has predicted that peak electricity demand will hit 85GW by 2050, up from 60GW today, because of factors such as the electrification of vehicles and home heating. The government said it could approve up to eight new reactors to help reach a target of generating 24GW of the total from nuclear power plants, which typically have more than one reactor. Some of the increase can be achieved by extending the life of the Sizewell B reactor, while the Hinkley Point C project is due for completion in 2027 and Rolls-Royce has the government’s blessing for small reactors nicknamed “mini-nukes”. Major projects that have already been through some form of planning, such as Sizewell C and Wylfa, on Anglesey, have been singled out by the government as among the first to win support. The target also implies new plants at sites whose locations have already been approved but where no plans are under way, such as Oldbury in Gloucestershire or Moorside (Sellafield) in Cumbria. While Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted global discussion on how to reduce reliance on Kremlin-controlled oil and gas, it appears to have cooled the government’s resolve to limit the UK’s own fossil fuel production. Drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea is at odds with the government’s own net-zero targets. The government will justify the plans by saying that local exploitation of hydrocarbons emits less carbon than importing supplies from elsewhere. Ministers have also commissioned a new study to examine safety concerns about fracking, which polls have shown is deeply unpopular with the public.  This article was amended on 7 April 2022. An earlier version said “targets for onshore wind and solar power generation will also be raised, in a push for 95% of Great Britain’s electricity to come from domestic renewable energy sources by 2030”. That should have referred to offshore wind and domestic low-carbon energy sources.\n",

      "Text: A powder blue airplane flew from London to Glasgow in September to deliver on a promise. Airlines around the world have committed to decarbonizing the industry – the British Airways flight was meant to demonstrate a decade of progress toward that goal. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), made partly from recycled cooking oil, along with more efficient engines, a sleeker design and improved air traffic management helped reduce the flight’s carbon emissions by 62% compared with a similar trip in 2010, according to BA. The airline was able to bill the trip as “carbon neutral” because it bought carbon credits to offset the remaining 38% of emissions. In demonstrating how far aviation has come, the flight showed the industry is far from carbon free. Commercial aviation emitted 918m metric tons of carbon in 2019, about half of which came from frequent flyers. The industry makes up about 2.5% of annual global emissions, but that figure will grow. Passenger travel rose nearly 300% between 1990 and 2019 and the pre-pandemic increases in traffic outpaced emissions savings from improved aircraft and air traffic efficiencies. Emissions could triple in the next three decades, according to some predictions, if aviation returns to its pre-Covid growth trajectory. The industry has been slow to decarbonize, in large part because fossil fuels continue to be by far the cheapest and easiest way to fuel planes. But there is movement. In October, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) committed to reach net zero emissions by 2050, following a slew of net zero commitments this year from large European and US airlines. To meet these targets, they are relying heavily on sustainable aviation fuel. SAF is seen as something of a holy grail for decarbonization, especially as zero-emissions aircraft powered by hydrogen and electricity are a decade or more away from commercial operation. Made from non-fossil-fuel feedstocks including cooking oils and agricultural waste, SAF could cut carbon emissions as much as 80% compared with conventional jet fuel, according to Iata. Research has shown that the use of SAF can also reduce engine soot and contrails, which have an even greater warming effect on the planet than aviation’s carbon emissions. And as a “drop-in” fuel that can be blended with kerosene, SAF is compatible with existing aircraft fuel systems. Dozens of aviation and energy companies – including Delta, American Airlines and BP – recently committed to replace 10% of global jet fuel with SAF by 2030. The problem is it’s expensive – up to eight times more than conventional jet fuel – and there’s not that much of it. About 100m litres (22m gallons) of SAF will be produced in 2021, according to IATA, a fraction of the 449bn litres (119bn gallons) the group estimates will be required by 2050 to keep to net zero commitments. Environmental advocates also warn that if demand for SAF is met by using crops as feedstock it may lead to deforestation to clear land and could compete with food production. Some scientists are hoping to help SAF scale by exploring the potential of waste. Derek Vardon, a researcher at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Colorado, investigates ways to make fuel from “wet waste”, including food scraps and municipal wastewater. “Despite a lot of recent buzz around increasing SAF production, there’s a limited amount of non-food fats, oils and greases to use,” he said. By diverting food waste that was destined to decay in landfill, Vardon and his colleagues say they can create SAF with a carbon footprint up to 165% lower than conventional jet fuel. US wet waste has the potential to replace roughly 20% of the country’s jet fuel consumption, according to a study co-authored by Vardon. At the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington state, Corinne Drennan, manager of bioenergy technologies programs, researches the potential of SAF that’s brewed from industrial waste gases. “These waste gases that have carbon in them can come from steel mill manufacturing, from refineries, from landfill gas, from lots of different places,” she said. Carbon-rich gases are fermented into ethanol and converted into a hydrocarbon fuel. Various feedstocks might supply the market for SAF, she said, “and as you aggregate [feedstocks], you begin to build impact.” One of the most hyped fuels for cutting emissions is synthetic fuel, also known as e-kerosene, e-fuel and power-to-liquid fuel. Made with carbon dioxide and hydrogen (produced from water using renewable energy), it can be used in existing fuel systems. “There is potentially an unlimited amount of renewable electricity to use for e-kerosene,” said Andrew Murphy, director of aviation for Transport & Environment, a green campaign group based in Brussels. When created using renewable electricity and carbon capture, synthetic fuel is nearly carbon neutral. In January, KLM flew a plane from Amsterdam to Madrid in what the company called the world’s first flight powered by synthetic fuel. Synthetic fuel made up around 5% of the fuel; the rest was conventional jet fuel, but the company said it was a step towards more widespread adoption. The German airline Lufthansa joined aviation and energy groups including Transport & Environment to write an open letter in July urging the EU to set ambitious goals for synthetic fuel production and has partnered with the transport company Kuehne+Nagel to buy 25,000 liters a year. Yet synthetic fuel is very expensive compared with conventional jet fuel and remains exceptionally limited in supply – and is likely to stay that way for at least the next decade. To scale up would require policy support and huge investment in the expansion of green energy infrastructure to provide enough electricity and carbon. Increasing the production of renewables like solar and wind power to supply synthetic fuel will be “very costly”, said Brandon Graver, a senior researcher at the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT). A lack of supply continues to be the big challenge to scaling up SAF from all sources, said Graver. “There needs to be a lot more investment,” he added. In the US, SAF production will take decades to scale, according to the Biden administration’s plan. The White House has set a goal of supplying 35bn gallons of SAF by 2050 but the US now produces only about 4.5m gallons a year. Europe’s shift to SAF is also likely to be a decades-long process. A recent report from the ICCT estimated that the bloc has the potential to produce 898m gallons of SAF by 2030 – 5.5% of projected jet fuel demand. The EU is considering a proposal that would require fuel suppliers to blend at least 2% of SAF into conventional jet fuel by 2025, 5% by 2030, and 63% by 2050. But while policymakers pin their hopes on alternative fuels, climate advocates question whether aviation has the tools to decarbonize within the narrow timeframe available. “They haven’t got the technologies for a genuine path to decarbonization,” said Cait Hewitt, policy director at the Aviation Environment Federation, a UK non-profit. Reducing aviation’s carbon impact will require sweeping changes to the industry and aggressive efforts to keep airplanes on the tarmac, she said. While passengers are increasingly given the option of offsetting their flight emissions, a number of investigations have found offset schemes to have serious credibility problems. Flying less often is one of the most climate-conscious lifestyle choices a person can make, according to research from Lund University in Sweden. That’s especially true for the 1% of the global population who produce 50% of aviation emissions. Abandoning air travel is a tough proposal to sell, particularly when many countries lack cheap, efficient and comprehensive rail networks. It’s an “escapist and unrealistic approach”, said Kwasi Adjekum, a professor of aviation at the University of North Dakota. “The reality is that air transportation is an essential part of global commerce and [the] supply chain network for goods and passengers.” But as research increasingly suggests that growth in aviation is incompatible with emissions goals, a growing number of people have committed to staying grounded. Some are driven by guilt; many have been inspired by climate activist Greta Thunberg. The “flight shame” movement Thunberg helped inspire was credited as one reason for a 4% drop in commercial flights in Sweden. It will take years to ramp up SAF production and even longer to develop zero-emissions aircraft, said Murphy from Transport & Environment: “Right now, flying less is the most effective way to reduce aviation emissions.”  This article was amended on 12 November 2021 to clarify that 50% of aviation emissions are produced by 1% of the global population, not “1% of flyers”, as an earlier version said.\n",

      "Text: Most air pollution is produced by the burning of fossil fuels and waste, and this is the focus of the World Health Organization’s global recommendations: Moving from coal and gas power stations and diesel generators to solar, wind and hydropower Prioritise walking, cycling and public transport over cars in urban areas and shift to electric cars Improve the energy efficiency of homes to reduce heating needs and avoid coal and wood burning inside Promoting waste reduction and use incineration only when unavoidable and when emissions controls are in place Reduce the burning of stubble in fields upwind of cities Create green spaces in cities to help remove some pollutants In the UK, the government’s extensive research shows deterring polluting vehicles from city and town centres is by far the quickest, most cost-effective way to cut levels of nitrogen dioxide pollution, which are at illegal levels in most urban areas. Other policies include: Retrofitting of buses, heavy goods vehicles and black cabs, which is the next most effective option Scrappage schemes for older, polluting vehicles and subsidies for electric vehicles can also help reduce pollution, although ministers have cut the latter Policies such as cutting speed limits on polluted motorway sections, labelling pollution levels clearly on new cars and training people to drive more cleanly all had minimal impact The solution to air pollution is stopping it at source but until that happens, experts including the British Lung Foundation (BLF) suggest the following: Avoid spending long periods of time in places where pollution builds up, such as busy roads If you travel on foot or a bike, using backstreet routes away from congested roads can cut exposure by half. Even on busy streets, cyclists experience less pollution than drivers Some scientists recommend parents use covers on their buggies to protect infants Go to work earlier, before the rush hour has begun and levels of pollution have built up When air pollution is high and if you have lung condition such as asthma, reduce or avoid strenuous outdoor exercise, or do your exercise inside There is very little evidence to recommend the use of face masks, according to the BLF\n",

      "Text: Greenhouse gas emissions from energy production rose strongly again last year, according to new data from the International Energy Agency, with a young fleet of coal-fired power plants in Asia accounting for a large proportion of the increase. Energy demand grew at its fastest pace this decade, with a 2.3% increase globally driving rises in fossil fuel consumption. Coal use in power stations was a third of the increase in energy consumption, and together gas and coal were responsible for nearly 70% of the growth in energy consumption, and while demand for solar and wind power also increased, it was by much less overall. Gas consumption in the US leapt by 10%, or the equivalent of the UK’s entire gas consumption in a year. Fracking has been a key driver, and oil production in the US also grew, while the dismantling of government incentives intended to reduce reliance on fossil fuels has continued. Asia is now responsible for the majority of coal-fired power generation globally, and the average age of power plants there is now just 12 years, meaning they have decades to go before reaching their planned end of production in about 30 to 50 years. Heating and cooling accounted for a fifth of the increase in global energy demand – the cooling needed for many areas to cope with global warming is an increasing factor in the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, as temperatures in some regions rose to record levels as the result of climate change. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, said last year had been a “golden” year for gas, which met nearly half of the growth in global demand for energy, but urged governments to take action that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. “We have seen an extraordinary increase in global energy demand in 2018, growing at its fastest pace this decade,” he said. “Last year can also be considered another golden year for gas. But despite major growth in renewables, global emissions are still rising, demonstrating once again that more urgent action is needed on all fronts.” He called for greater development of non-fossil fuel energy sources, action from governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and investment in the capture and storage of carbon dioxide, as ways to reduce the impact of energy production on climate change. Energy efficiency has been increasingly ignored, the IEA found, despite the economic gains to be had from relatively simple measures to curb energy waste. Nuclear reactors met 9% of the increase in global electricity demand last year, according to the IEA’s analysis, as newly built plants in China came onstream and facilities in Japan were reopened after the Fukushima disaster at the beginning of the decade.  This article was amended on 26 March 2019 because coal use did not rise by a third, as an earlier version said, it accounted for a third of the rise in energy consumption.\n",

      "Text: “Will this story make a difference?” It’s a question journalists ask themselves all the time. The answer is rarely clearcut, and there is no shortage of stories that barely make a ripple. But there have been a number of occasions in recent years on the Guardian’s environment desk when the answer has been a resounding yes. The media is part of a social nervous system, alerting the public to remote danger in the same way neurotransmitters tell the brain the tips of the fingers are being burned. We serve as amplifiers that enable weak or remote voices to reach a wide audience and centres of decision making. And, of course, we also have a role as watchdogs, holding political authority to account. These roles – of transmission, amplification and investigation – are all vital elements in any effective response to the world’s environmental breakdown. The Earth is an extraordinary piece of evolutionary engineering that has self-regulated itself for millions of years. That homeostasis is now being destabilised by human activities. Scientists tell us it is not too late to fix this, but we need to start the repair work urgently. Journalists can facilitate that. That is because we can connect the local and the global, which is an essential part of any solution. The climate crisis, collapse of natural life support systems, rise of zoonotic diseases and the pollution of air, water and soil are often first apparent in distant regions and poor communities, though the cause and ultimate consequences can be found in wealthier and more densely populated cities. As we have learned with Covid-19, unless problems are identified and dealt with early and at a local level, the health and economic costs can be horrendous as they later spread and expand across the world. The Guardian makes those connections because it has an internationalist and social perspective and is not owned by a tycoon or corporate interests. This independence sets it apart from most other media organisations, which have a narrower domestic and economic focus, or see their role as entertainers to distract readers, or echo-chambers that reinforce prejudices. Instead of putting distance between the UK and the rest of the world, we are more likely to explore what links us together, which is essential if we are going to address global environmental problems. Finding out how people are affected and fighting back at a local level was a goal of the Green Blood series on the threats posed to environmental activists and journalists who cover the mining sector. This has made a difference. Soon after the findings were published by the Guardian and its 35 partner media organisations, Guatemala’s constitutional court upheld a request from indigenous campaigners to suspend operations at one of the largest nickel mines in Central America due to the facility’s environmental impact. Similarly, reports of human rights abuses and environmental negligence at the North Mara goldmine in Tanzania prompted multinational corporations such as Apple, Nokia and Canon to review their supply chains. The refiner, MMTC-PAMP, and the mine’s owner, Barrick, have subsequently organised an inquiry into risk management practices at North Mara. The Guardian continues to scrutinise the operator’s promise to pay more heed to the concerns of the local community and environment. Similarly, the Defenders series on the killings of environmental and land activists continues to have ramifications. In the past two years, two of those profiled have won landmark lawsuits. In South Africa, courts ruled against a proposed titanium mine that would have torn up land belonging to the Xolobeni community on the Wild Coast. In Kenya, judges awarded $12m in damages to the residents of the Owino Uhuru shantytown for deaths and health impacts from a nearby lead smelter for recycling batteries. In both cases, local activists risked their lives to campaign against powerful economic interests because they were concerned about pollution and other forms of environmental degradation. Media coverage did not decide their cases. But without the international spotlight, their courage and determination would not have received the kind of prominence that can sway opinion. A recent case in point concerned Chinese mining company plans to explore coal deposits in Zimbabwe’s Hwange national park. Local conservationists were keen to get the message out internationally because domestic reports suggested the government was ready to put economic interests above the sanctity of one of the world’s most important homes for elephants, rhinos, cheetahs, giraffes and other wildlife. It worked. Days after stories were published in the Guardian and other media, the authorities announced they would block the plan. Similarly, in Brazil, the world’s biggest meat packing company, JBS, announced in September it would axe suppliers linked to Amazon deforestation. This policy was a turnaround from its previous stance and followed a series of articles by the Guardian in collaboration with Repórter Brasil and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism about the company’s lax oversight of its supply chain. Of course, many other factors are involved in such decisions. Measuring the influence of a story is far harder than counting page views and social media shares. But it is clearly important or corporations and governments would not spend billions on public relations campaigns to avoid negative publicity. In that vein, the Guardian has taken several major steps to try to shape public opinion in favour of greater action on the climate crisis. The biggest environment reporting project of recent years was the Polluters, an old-school piece of investigative journalism that aimed to name and shame the fossil fuel companies, financial companies, public relations firms, thinktanks and politicians that have contributed the most to the climate crisis. This was a cross-disciplinary collaboration of more than 20 journalists across environment, business, investigations, data journalism, video, podcast, graphics and foreign news desks in five countries, with support from universities and NGOs. After eight months of preparation, the newspaper and website led with hard-hitting exposes every day for a week. This intense focus demonstrated the importance the Guardian places on a topic of growing public concern. It generated debate across the political spectrum and within the boardrooms of some of the world’s biggest companies, and it contributed – along with the upsurge in climate activism – to a growing number of announcements by the likes of BP, Shell and several banks and insurance companies to accelerate the shift away from carbon-intensive industries.  We also know we can and should do more. As Greta Thunberg and others have pointed out, the climate and nature crises are so pressing they should be the subjects of the top headline on every news website and TV channel. There are still countless untold and under-reported stories. Scientists tell us the world needs to accelerate an energy, transport and food system transformation on a scale unprecedented in history. That is both alarming and exciting. Business as usual is not enough. Nor is journalism as usual.\n",

      "Text: Removing coal from the global energy mix is taking too long, too many forests are still being destroyed, and fossil fuel subsidies are ongoing despite their distorting effect on the market, a study has found. There has also been insufficient progress in agriculture to stop harmful practices that increase carbon dioxide production, and heavy industry is not doing enough to use energy more efficiently, according to analysis carried out by the World Resources Institute thinktank. Without progress on all these fronts, the world is unlikely to see global greenhouse gas emissions peak in 2020, which is likely to be necessary to stay within the 1.5C or 2C warming thresholds that scientists have identified as key to the future safety of the planet. But the analysis also found important steps forward, on renewable energy, curtailing greenhouse gas emissions from shipping, and public sector investment in reducing emissions. These suggest progress in other aspects of tackling climate change is also possible, with greater effort from the public and private sectors. The WIR looked at six key goals that have been pegged as necessary to cause emissions to peak in 2020 and achieve the targets of the 2015 Paris agreement. They include goals on energy, transport, land use, industry, infrastructure and finance. The report found that renewable energy accounted for about a quarter of global electricity generation in 2017, and more than two-thirds of new power generation capacity. By 2020, electricity from renewables is likely to be consistently cheaper than fossil fuel energy, making it possible that 30% of electricity could come from renewable sources by 2030, one of the Mission2020 milestones. But coal-fired generation is still increasing, with coal-fired power plants continuing to be built in some areas, while existing plants are not being removed from service fast enough. Electric vehicles, meanwhile, comprise 1.4% of overall sales, making a 2020 milestone of 15% of new car sales hard to reach. The goals are the work of Mission 2020, a global coalition of several climate analysis organisations, headed by Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who negotiated the Paris accord. Mission 2020 has calculated that if these milestones are achieved by 2020, it will make the longer-term Paris goals possible – because progress now on reducing emissions will make it easier and cheaper to reduce them in the longer term – and wants to spur sufficient progress on climate change to bring that about. Figueres is attending the World Economic Forum in Davos to press political and business leaders for more support for climate change initiatives. She said: “The impacts [of climate change] have never been as clear, nor action so urgent, as we are quickly approaching tipping points of no return. It would follow, then, that leaders everywhere should now be discussing this number one concern as their number one priority.” She added: “The decisions we take over the next two to three years are crucial for the unprecedented structural changes we must embark on to safeguard our climate and clean up our air. This is the make it or break it opportunity we have, knowing that the world is expected to invest about $90tn on infrastructure in the period up to 2030, with much of this investment to be programmed in the next few years.”\n",

      "Text: Petrostates fought fiercely against the call from 130 nations at Cop28 for a fossil fuel phase-out. That is because they are engaged in a colossal fossil fuel phase-up, already working on double the extraction that the planet can cope with. This is the foundation of the climate crisis: carbon emissions must plunge rapidly to avoid climate catastrophe. But the fossil fuel industry is pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into extracting more oil, gas and coal. It is betting that the world will not curb emissions and therefore not curb its trillion-dollar profits. Cop28 could have bust the industry’s bet with a clear statement that fossil fuels must be phased out. It did not. Instead, a call to “transition away” from fossil fuels, shot through with loopholes, will not be enough to frighten investors away from the precious resources. The fight is existential for both the fossil fuel industry and the rest of civilisation, but only one can prosper. “We are facing a confrontation between fossil capital and human life,” the Colombian president, Gustavo Petro, told delegates in Dubai. But the petrostates came to Cop28 to fight by all means necessary. Extraordinary leaked letters from the oil cartel Opec to its members, reported by the Guardian, revealed their panic about the prospect of a call for a phase-out. “Undue and disproportionate pressure against fossil fuels may reach a tipping point with irreversible consequences,” the letters said. “It would be unacceptable that politically motivated campaigns put our people’s prosperity and future at risk.” The deadly irony was not lost on delegates that the biggest risk to prosperity – and the most feared tipping points – come directly from the climate emergency driven by Opec’s products. Spain’s ecology minister called the letters “disgusting”, while delegates from vulnerable countries warned that a weak deal would be a death warrant. Cop28 was hosted by a petrostate, the United Arab Emirates, and run by the boss of its state oil company, Adnoc. Sultan Al Jaber delivered a historic first mention of a fossil fuel transition. But his pitch was that, as an oil baron, he could drag the industry on to the path to climate salvation. He could not, and now returns to Adnoc, which has the biggest net-zero-busting plans of any company on Earth. This was a moment of truth for the fossil fuel industry, after decades of lies and deceit. But it chose further lies, about “low-carbon” gas and mass carbon capture to mop up fossil emissions. So if the fossil fuel industry cannot reform itself, even when it is running the show, how do we end its hegemony over the planet’s life support systems? Cops will continue their slow but essential consensus-based work. But the good news is that there are many other ways. International regulations, like the EU’s carbon border tax, can penalise dirty producers. Methane limits can block the import of gas produced with excessive methane leaks. Climate clubs of nations can accelerate green action together, and exclude or penalise free-riding polluters. Taxation on fossil fuels, and international aviation and shipping, is being seriously discussed after the establishment of a new taskforce at Cop28. Ending the insanity of the $7tn (£5.5tn) a year in subsidies that benefit fossil fuels would cut global emissions by 34% by 2030 – a large chunk of the 43% cut needed – and is starting to happen, from Nigeria to Canada. People can confront the fossil fuel industry too. Protests can stop projects and help destroy the industry’s social licence to operate. Voting for climate-positive politicians narrows the space in which it can operate. There are many other possibilities, most especially for the global middle class, which produces 50% of all emissions. Putting pensions in green pots and choosing electric cars, heat pumps, and trains over planes all help keep fossil fuels in the ground. The end of the fossil fuel era will not be delivered by its suppliers. Just before Cop28, the Guardian reported on Saudi Arabia’s shocking plan to “hook” developing countries on oil. The UN’s climate chief, Simon Stiell, gave an honest assessment of the Dubai summit’s progress just after the deal had been hammered through: “Cop28 needed to signal a hard stop to fossil fuels and their planet-burning pollution. We didn’t turn the page on the fossil fuel era, but this is clearly the beginning of the end. Loopholes [in the agreement] leave us vulnerable to fossil fuel vested interests.” His boss, António Guterres, had a clear parting message to the petrostates. The UN secretary general said: “To those who opposed a clear reference to a phase-out of fossil fuels in the Cop28 text, I want to say that a fossil fuel phase out is inevitable whether they like it or not. Let’s hope it doesn’t come too late.”\n",

The government believes badger killing will eliminate bovine tuberculosis but won’t publish details of the zones, arguing public safety might be compromised. However, much of the killing takes place on land to which the citizen has some access. Disclosure would equip citizens to make informed judgments about their safety and that of their pets and about whether the shooting and trapping in their own backyard is legal or not. They could then engage in legitimate protest about the systematic killing of our native wildlife – in short, ensuring licence holders and the government can be held to account. The information commissioner has ruled the data should be freely available but, conveniently, much of the detail rests with the organisations licensed to kill badgers, the “control companies”, to which freedom of information obligations do not apply. Most of us will only find out that they live within a killing zone by hearing the sound of gunfire.Jonathon Porritt Forum for the FutureMark Jones Born Free FoundationAlick SimmonsChris Cheeseman  Culling badgers by shooting is a very expensive and possibly ineffective method for controlling badger numbers. Could a form of oral contraception be used instead? Badgers love to eat peanuts, as seen on the BBC programme Autumnwatch. The necessary research would be needed, but soaking peanuts in an oral contraceptive solution and suitable, targeted baiting seems a useful alternative to shooting.

      "Text: We were surprised to see the negative focus of the article regarding carbon capture and storage (UK government gambles on carbon capture and storage tech despite scientists’ doubts, 30 March). Far from unproven, this group of technologies is being applied on many tens of industrial CO2 capture projects, including two operating offshore (Sleipner and Snohvit), which have been capturing a million tonnes of CO2 a year for 27 years and 15 years respectively. The geography professor quoted in the article as being unaware of any CCS that works should perhaps take a trip to see one. There are a diversity of opinions on the viability of CCS, and scientists are not uniformly doubting – see the Royal Society report from 2022. It is also clear from Emily Shuckburgh and Bob Ward that CCS is imperative, which flows directly from the executive summary of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s March 2023 sixth assessment report that mentions “Transition from fossil fuels … To very low carbon fossil fuels with CCS”. The argument against CCS, that it is unproven – aside from being incorrect – is circular. The IPCC says we need it; everyone, including our committee on climate change, agrees we need it for industrial processes. And if it were unproven we should quickly get on with proving it in the UK, while driving up efficiency and decreasing hydrocarbon extraction.Prof Paul Fennell Imperial College LondonTim Dixon IEAGHGProf Jon Gibbins University of Sheffield Prof Stuart Haszeldine University of EdinburghProf Niall Mac Dowell Imperial College LondonProf Geoffrey Maitland Imperial College London  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

      "Text: Giant livestock farms and privatised water firms accused of polluting the nation’s waterways are to be named in what is thought to be the world’s first livestreamed investigative documentary. The crowdfunded investigation Rivercide, which will be broadcast online at 7pm on Wednesday, will be hosted by environmental journalist and Guardian columnist George Monbiot. Monbiot will travel along the River Wye, which flows between England and Wales, to collect water samples that will be analysed as the documentary unfolds. “This is a really shocking story of how our rivers are being devastated,” said Monbiot. “We’ll be revealing some serious wrongdoing.” The broadcast will also link to locations in Yorkshire and the east of England with similar problems. The documentary comes as concern grows about the scale of human and animal waste washing into rivers and seas. Just 14% of English rivers are classed as being in a healthy condition, with sewage releases accounting for 36% of the damage to waterways, and runoff from agricultural industries responsible for 40%. Last week Southern Water was fined a record £90m for knowingly dumping billions of litres of raw sewage over several years. Analysis suggests only a tiny proportion of illegal discharges ever leads to a prosecution and the Environment Agency, which monitors river pollution, has lost nearly two-thirds of its budget since 2010. “A huge part of what we’re looking at is the total failure of government. I don’t just mean the Westminster government – I mean all four nations,” said Monbiot. “There’s been a slashing of monitoring and enforcement to the point of which you can get away with anything.” The live documentary is being directed by Franny Armstrong, known for her films Age of Stupid and McLibel, on a budget of just £70,000. “It used to be that only mega-corporations could make a live event, with outside broadcast trucks and hundreds of thousands of pounds,” said Armstrong. “But mobile phone streaming technology means that just a few of us can make something which can be watched globally for free. It was too irresistible not to try.” Armstrong believes the live broadcast brings a sense of risk to environmental film-making, which can sometimes make for grim, serious viewing. “This format has got an added element of jeopardy, which will make it a hell of a lot more fun to watch,” she said. “People are going to be wondering ‘is George about to fall off that boat?’ or ‘is the live stream going to go down?’ It has a Challenge Anneka feel to it.” Monbiot will be joined by singer Charlotte Church and poet Owen Sheers, who have composed an original song for the broadcast. Poet Benjamin Zephaniah will also perform. The production team did not approach traditional broadcasters about the live stream. “Even if you somehow got through the commissioning editors, it would just have been killed by officialdom,” said Monbiot. “The big broadcasters have become much more cautious. When I started at the BBC in the 1980s, there was a real excitement about journalism. But the sense that you could do anything bold and dangerous has completely gone.” Monbiot decided to focus on the River Wye after a disturbing canoeing trip last summer. He found the Wye, which was once prized for its salmon, had changed beyond all recognition over the course of a decade. “There hadn’t been any rain so it should have been crystal clear but you couldn’t see anything,” he said. “I made the mistake of going swimming. As soon as my nostrils got near the water I nearly gagged because it was so disgusting. When I got out, my whole body felt like it was coated in slimy snot. It was like something out of a 1970s science fiction film.” “Rivers are the life support system on which all life depends but we are literally pouring shit into them,” said Armstrong. “In a civilised society, and the sixth richest country in the world, you’d think keeping water clean would be job number one? But this government can’t even do that.”\n",

      "Predicted Category: Fossil_fuels\n",
      "Text: Renewable energy accounted for almost half of all new power plants in 2014, representing a “clear sign that an energy transition is underway”, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Green energy is now the second-largest generator of electricity in the world, after coal, and is set to overtake the dirtiest fossil fuel in the early 2030s, said the IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2015 report, published on Tuesday. “The biggest story is in the case of renewables,” said IEA executive director, Fatih Birol. “It is no longer a niche. Renewable energy has become a mainstream fuel, as of now.” He said 60% of all new investment was going into renewables but warned that the $490bn of fossil fuel subsidies in 2014 meant there was not a “fair competition”. Amid the energy transition, the IEA said the price of oil, currently under $50 a barrel, was likely to recover only to $80 by 2020 and see modest growth beyond. The IEA said investment in oil exploration and production was set to fall by 20% in 2015, as high cost projects in the US, Canada, Russia and Brazil continue to be shelved. But it said US shale oil producers could move back into profit with prices of $60-$70 a barrel. The IEA, which was founded in response to the oil shocks of the 1970s, also warned that if the oil price remained at $50 for a decade or more, cheaper oil from the Middle East would come to dominate exports, with 75% market share. Birol said that the scenario was “unlikely”, but that if it came to pass, “reliance on a very few number of countries in a region that is in turmoil may not be the best news for oil security.” “Now is not the time to relax,” he said. “Quite the opposite: a period of low oil prices is the moment to reinforce our capacity to deal with future energy security threats.” The rapid rise of renewables charted in the new IEA report will lead to a dramatic slowdown in the growth of carbon emissions, the agency said. But, just weeks ahead of a crunch UN climate change summit in Paris, the IEA calculated that the world was still on course for 2.7C of global warming, significantly above the 2C considered to be the threshold of dangerous warming. “A major course correction is still required,” said the report. “World leaders meeting in Paris must set a clear direction for the accelerated transformation of the global energy sector,” said Birol. “The difference between 2.7C and 2C is not something meaning you can take your jacket off and adapt to life - it will have major implications for all of us.” The IEA projects “turbulent times” ahead for coal: “Coal has increased its share of the global energy mix from 23% in 2000 to 29% today, but the momentum behind coal’s surge is ebbing away and the fuel faces a reversal of fortune.” It projects a 15% share by 2040. Huge changes in China are a major factor in coal’s decline, said Birol: “The era of the China boom in terms of energy demand growth is coming to an end. This is a major story and has implications for the entire world.” He said China had the biggest energy efficiency programme in the world and that “China is the champion of renewables”, as well having a major nuclear programme and likely growth in unconventional gas. But the IEA expects coal demand is set to triple in India and in south-east Asia by 2040. “South-east Asia is amazingly important and not getting much attention,” said Birol. “It is the only region in the world where the coal demand is increasing its share.” He said, in the absence of climate policies, cheap coal and renewables would squeeze out gas in the region. “India is moving to the centre stage of energy,” said Birol, becoming the main global driver of coal consumption and oil demand in the world by 2040 as well as accounting for 20% of the globe’s solar power installations. “The choices India makes will be important for all of us, and therefore there is a need for supporting India’s push for clean and efficient technologies.” Benjamin Sporton, chief executive of the World Coal Association, said: “This IEA report is a reminder of the continuing role of coal and the need to ensure it is used as cleanly as possible through the use of low-emission coal technologies.” The IEA has been criticised in the past for underestimating the speed of solar energy deployment. “The global breakthrough of renewable energy has happened much faster than anticipated,” said Emily Rochon, global energy strategist at Greenpeace International. “The IEA is catching up on renewable energy trends, but it is still failing to see the full potential of change. We believe that with the right level of policy support, the world can deliver 100% renewable energy for all by 2050.” Birol said the IEA’s previous forecasts for hydropower and wind power had been correct and that solar projections were based on the government support existing at the time. “If the policies change, the numbers will change as well,” he said. “They may need to be revised [upwards] next year. I hope so.”\n",

      "Text: A UK company that turns carbon dioxide into protein to be used for animal feed has raised €8m (£6.8m) in funding as it seeks to displace the use of deforestation-linked soy by farmers. Carbon and hydrogen are fed to a microorganism in a fermentation process similar to what you would see in a brewery. But rather than alcohol, the output is a high-value protein that can be dried and converted into pellets to feed animals. The need for natural sources of protein such as soy and fishmeal has long been an environmental headache for farmers with animals to feed. Soy is linked to deforestation in regions such as the Amazon, and fishmeal requires large quantities of wild-caught fish to produce. In contrast, the protein created by startup Deep Branch will rely on recycling carbon from industrial emitters. The waste gas will need to go through a chemical purification process to separate the carbon dioxide from other gases before it can be used to produce protein. “There are big sustainability drawbacks from the proteins we currently use to produce animal products like salmon fillets and chicken drumsticks,” said Deep Branch’s co-founder, Peter Rowe, “but we can produce a high-quality protein without requiring any arable land or fish.” Rowe said animal producers faced increased competition for feedstocks such as soy and fishmeal and that Deep Branch’s protein, which is being produced in Europe, offered a more secure food source less affected by geopolitics, seasonality or climate. Insects have also been touted as a sustainable protein-rich alternative to soy and fishmeal, but Rowe said his firm’s protein would be easier to scale up and produce at lower cost, if it can locate next to industrial plants capturing carbon. The company will start commercial trials of its feed on chickens and salmon by the summer. “It won’t all be plain sailing from here, though,” said Mike Allen, a professor in environmental sciences at the University of Exeter and Plymouth Marine Laboratory. “I imagine they will face significant challenges with scaling up their process, and they’ll still need to blend their product with other types of biomass to provide the full nutrient profile required for healthy animal growth.” The startup has already attracted support from leading animal feed companies in Europe, BioMar and AB Agri, and is close to agreeing to build its first commercial production facility in Norway, where it hopes to supply the country’s aquaculture sector. Norway is the world’s leading salmon exporter and has a number of carbon capture and storage projects in development. However, Allen said the company should not be seen as a climate-saving project. “Any process that utilises industrial CO2 emissions is great in theory, but they’ll have to be honest and realistic about how much CO2 they are actually remediating, and what their overall carbon footprint is. “Most of the CO2 run through their bioreactors will pass straight through, I imagine. And the hydrogen will come with a carbon footprint too. This isn’t a carbon capture technology, despite how it may be branded – it’s a protein production platform,” he said. While global demand for meat remained high, Rowe said, Deep Branch’s protein feed was a more sustainable alternative to soy or fishmeal. “Yes, reducing meat consumption also reduces our impact on the environment, but not everyone sees it that way, so if we can reduce the impact of animal protein production, then that’s only a good thing,” he said. WWF said it welcomed attempts to reduce dependence on soy. “These bacterial processes using excess materials like carbon dioxide and agricultural byproducts are a good thing, as they don’t, like soy, cause deforestation, biodiversity loss and don’t need freshwater or fertiliser,” said the charity’s aquaculture lead, Piers Hart. “We shouldn’t be using precious land and fresh water to grow crops for feed when it could be used to grow crops for food, so we shouldn’t be using soy and maize to feed animals. “Whether they [alternative proteins] will completely displace soy will come down to cost in the end. We hope that increasing demand and scaling production will bring the price down and also that people will say that, yes, it may be slightly more expensive, but it’s that much better for the planet that we will use it,” said Hart.\n",

      "Text: I am getting married next year and when going to buy so-called 100% biodegradable \"sky lanterns\" I have been disgusted to find that they contain metal wires which obviously take years to degrade. Beautiful and fairly cheap they may be, but I for one will not allow even the possibility of harming animals to come from my wedding, and I strongly believe that others will feel the same – if they have the knowledge. Saffron Light, by email Less of a question, more of a statement, but I take your point, Saffron. I, too, have wondered about what happens to these sky lanterns once their brief blaze of glory begins to fade and they fall back to the ground. They are, indeed, a fairly splendid sight as they drift away into the night sky. But, as with the release of helium-filled balloons at a charity event, they must fall back to earth somewhere resulting in – at the very least – an eyesore for someone to clean up. The claim made by some of the sky lantern retailers about their products being \"biodegradable\" is certainly worth exploring. If these paper lanterns did, indeed, rot away within a matter of days, then they might possibly claim to be environmentally benign. But, as you point out, they contain a thin metal wire support. I rang one of the UK's leading online sky lantern retailers and asked its sales representative to put some flesh on this \"biodegradable\" claim. He said that the paper biodegrades within \"six to eight weeks\", and claimed that the \"flourished wire\" take nine months, on average, to break down. How did he know this? \"The manufacturers did some tests. But the wire is only eight inches long and accounts for just 1% of the lantern's mass.\" Who are the manufacturers? \"I don't know. They used to be in Thailand, but I think we get them from Japan now.\" This answer intrigued me, because on the company's website it says that all its products are \"sourced ethically\" and that it \"operates a fair trade agreement with our manufacturers\". This led me to assume that it must have a very close relationship with its suppliers, so why the confusion about where the sky lanterns are sourced? I asked what this \"fair trade\" claim meant. \"Some of our competitors pay under the minimum wage in these countries. We ensure that we pay a fair wage.\" But such statements are next to meaningless without any form of proof or certification. I came away from the conversation with far more concerns and questions than I entered it. For example, why should the claim that the wire takes nine months to break down be presented as a means of reassurance? Wire lying on the ground for nine months is surely a considerable hazard, depending on where it lands, for farm animals or children. And can metal wire really break down so quickly? I'm always digging up old bits of wire fencing in my garden (formerly a field) which must have been there for years, if not decades. Back in April, a farmer who runs a wedding venue in the Staffordshire Moorlands banned the use of sky lanterns on his land due to similar concerns (thanks to the Guardian user Yamaman for a link that led me to the story). Mick Heath of Heaton House farm told the North Staffordshire and South Cheshire Sentinel: \"Brides and grooms ask if they can let them off, but they do not understand that the wire in them takes ages to break down. He added: Margaret Heath, Mr Heath's wife, expressed an additional concern: \"There is also the danger that if they come down alight they could start a fire on the moorlands, a fire in a tinder-dry cornfield or even someone's house. We really do not know where they are going to come down.\" Sky lanterns have long been a tradition in east Asia. You only have to look at this footage of a sky lantern festival in Chiang Mai in Thailand to see how popular they are – and how potentially dangerous they can be when lit en mass. But the party could be coming to an end. Last week, the Vietnamese prime minister, Nguyen Tan Dung, announced that a sky lantern ban would take effect from mid-September, says a report by VOV News: In Thailand, too, some local authorities are now starting to ban the sale of sky lanterns ahead of major festivals. And closer to home, three German states have now banned the sale of the lanterns following the death of a 10-year-old boy in a house fire caused by a sky lantern in North Rhine-Westphalia. Even the UK coastguard is now starting to express concern about the site of these lanterns drifting out to see and mimicking the sight of distress flares. I doubt it will be too long before a ban is considered here in the UK.\n",

      "Text: The night before publication, Henning Steinfeld was halfway across the world dealing with panicked politicians and an outbreak of avian flu. His report, and how it would be received, was frankly the last thing on his mind. With a small group of officials, Steinfield, head of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)’s livestock policy branch, had been working for months on a report analysing the link between the six major species of livestock and climate change, which they all knew could be explosive. “I was very frustrated by the fact that the livestock-environment issue hadn’t resonated even though people accepted in private that it was a big issue – for climate change, and also water and biodiversity,” he said. “But no one was interested in getting into it because I think they were afraid of what it could mean.” Another FAO official, “Michel Criollo” (not his real name), remembered: “No one wanted to go to the next step of saying agriculture is a problem for the planet and we need to mitigate it – including by potentially reducing production levels or changing things in less profitable ways.” It was 2006. The issue of climate change was climbing the international agenda, although the bitter rows and collapsing dialogue of the Copenhagen summit were still three years in the future. But although the link between climate change and fossil fuels was accepted and widely discussed, somehow the farming sector had managed to dodge the spotlight. Scientists were aware that the methane produced by grazing cattle – around two-thirds of livestock emissions come from cows – was a significant chunk of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases that were heating the planet’s atmosphere. Still, there had been no attempt to quantify how large a chunk it might be; the scientific community was largely focused elsewhere, while politicians were finding it hard enough to cope with the political realities of reducing fossil fuel consumption. The FAO was not the obvious candidate to jump into the breach. Founded in 1945 with the remit of ending hunger and improving nutrition by increasing agricultural – and livestock – production, it was a country-based organisation, which felt that part of its mission was to represent the industry rather than scrutinise it. The small group of researchers who worked with Steinfeld had been discussing this issue for several years and felt the time was right to dig into it. But they knew that they would face resistance from the organisation and from beyond. “Everyone knows that meat and other livestock products are closely connected to culture and ways of living,” Steinfeld said, “to traditions, beliefs, religion and identity issues that define people, and here we have something that challenges that.” But none of them were quite prepared for the storm that broke over their heads when Livestock’s Long Shadow (LLS) finally came out, cracking through the taboos. Now, for the first time, some of them have spoken to the Guardian about a period and a working culture in which, they say, they were censored, sabotaged, undermined and victimised. It is so unusual for officials working in a UN agency to allow a peek behind the scenes that almost all of them would only speak on condition of anonymity, still, to some extent, marked by the battles they fought while working at the FAO. Livestock’s Long Shadow was the first elementary lifecycle analysis for livestock and, crucially, the first tally of the meat and dairy sector’s ecological cost. The report estimated that livestock were responsible for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions – including nine percent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, mostly due to deforestation for (pasture and) feed crops, 37% of anthropogenic methane emissions, largely from cow burps, 65% of anthropogenic nitrous oxides, overwhelmingly from manure and 64% of anthropogenic ammonia emissions. It was a bombshell. Environmental scientists and campaign groups were rapturous, and a wave of popular documentaries such as Meat the Truth and Cowspiracy followed. But the report had sent shockwaves through the meat industry and the tremors travelled quickly. Steinfeld remembered hearing complaints that “the FAO has fallen into the hands of vegan activists” and personal threats such as “the anti-livestock people are a pest that needs to be eradicated”. Pressure came from all sides. The big meat-producing countries – Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, Australia and the US – all complained to the FAO’s higher echelons, according to Steinfeld, while protests also flooded in from “the private sector, the large-scale meat, feed and dairy producers”. Another FAO official “Angus Green” remembered the shock that the FAO would produce a report on this topic. “People were complaining: ‘Why do we need such a report? Livestock is so important. It’s the best way to alleviate poverty for farmers in poor countries.’ You can’t imagine how controversial the subject of climate change in agriculture was at that time.” Hans R Herren, a World Food Prize winner and co-chair of the UN/World Bank Global Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology (IAASTD), told the Guardian: “It’s clear that there is corridor pressure by the main agri-producers in the FAO. It’s indirect because it comes from outside, but everybody knows how powerful some of those countries are. People think they have to pass on the message to whoever ‘priced’ those reports. There is a chain of pressure because the FAO, like most agencies, depends on external funds, so that’s one way of exerting pressure.” The pressure was soon to become more intense. LLS had included a line saying that livestock emissions were “an even larger contribution [to global heating] than the transportation sector worldwide”. One of the paper’s authors described the factoid as a “slight methodological error” that had only been inserted because of a request from the FAO press office, which “wanted to add some hype to the report. They suggested this might be included as a statement and we didn’t think about it enough.” The line was eventually cut from the paper but the error was seized on by the report’s critics. International press such as the BBC and Daily Telegraph jumped on the story with CNN, running it under the headline “Scientist: Don’t blame cows for climate change!” The leadership at the FAO were taken by surprise by the backlash, according to sources, and the impact would be felt for the next decade, just at the moment that it became ever more important to look honestly at agriculture’s planet-heating role. In a sign of the atmosphere in the FAO at this time, a fourth veteran insider, “Mary Wagyu”, claims to have been admonished after preparing Meatless Monday leaflets for distribution in the cafeteria of an FAO heads of state food security summit in 2008. “Remove and destroy them,” a senior FAO executive said, according to Wagyu. “These will not be put in people’s trays.” In 2009 a second FAO report called Livestock in the Balance was delayed for several months while the FAO’s leadership tried to dilute references to harm caused by the meat industry, arguing that this had already been covered by Livestock’s Long Shadow. When the research team resisted the pressure, management stepped in and manually rewrote key passages over their heads, sparking what Steinfeld called “a mini-revolution”. About a dozen staff members involved in preparing the report withdrew their names from the paper in protest. “We took a collective stand to defend – in our view – the professional integrity of this report,” Steinfeld said. “This was the first time there was visible opposition [on the livestock question].” Steinfeld recalled being told by a senior official in the director general’s office: “Even if livestock contributes 18% to climate change, the FAO shall not say that. It’s not in the interest of the FAO to highlight environmental impacts.” The report was seen as “very problematic and the DG’s office wanted to dampen its messages,” according to “David Holstein”, another former official. “The issue was [the report] presenting statements that livestock was not hunky dory. The response was, therefore, censorship.” In the end, the second report was published with its references to environmental impacts intact. That same year an IAASTD study called Agriculture at the crossroads by Herren was co-sponsored with the FAO. The paper outlined the environmental problems caused by livestock, singling it out as a “major contributor” to global heating and “probably the largest sectoral source of water pollution”. “The report was basically buried at the FAO,” Herren said. He described “huge pressure” not to publicise the paper from funding countries such as the US and Australia – which entered “reservations” about the report as an annex. “When I was invited to give a talk to the FAO plenary, the organiser told me: ‘You’re welcome to talk but you cannot mention the IAASTD report.’ He didn’t say why but I believe it was because the report recommended a food system transformation that was not in line with what some of the major FAO-supporting countries had in mind.” And meanwhile the impact on the lives and careers of the rebellious researchers had been profound, according to Steinfeld. “We were considered a difficult group and difficult individuals, and this is how others described us. We were not [with] the party line.” Not all ex-FAO officials the Guardian spoke to agreed that the careers of colleagues who spoke out on livestock issues suffered as a result. But another FAO researcher at the time, “Jean Charolais”, remembers the atmosphere. “There was substantial pressure internally and there were consequences for permanent staff who worked on this, in terms of their careers. It wasn’t really a healthy environment to work in,” he said. Several former staff members compared the power of the agribusiness lobby over FAO policy to that of the oil and gas giants on energy policy. As Green put it: “It is all about money, similar to the fossil fuel industry.” Between 2012 and 2019, “the lobbyists obviously managed to influence things”, Holstein said. “They had a strong impact on the way things were done at the FAO and there was a lot of censorship. It was always an uphill struggle getting the documents you produced past the office for corporate communications and one had to fend off a good deal of editorial vandalism. You had to accept relatively small steps forward in changing the narrative on livestock.” Steinfeld added that meat lobby representatives and diplomats would talk to senior FAO managers and encourage them not to invest in work that dealt with environmental impacts. The group set up an umbrella organisation – the Global Agenda for Sustainable Livestock (GASL) – to bring together NGOs, scientists, industry and governments and focus on the issue. But GASL was undermined by the FAO leadership, which suffered from “a lot of incompetence and ignorance” and at senior levels “actually did not understand different greenhouse gases and sources of emissions”, according to Steinfeld. The FAO leadership did all they could to “obstruct and torpedo our effort”, he continued. When one minister from a Latin-American country flew to Rome in 2017 to meet the group – after offering to host a GASL meeting – Steinfeld claimed that he was picked up at the airport by a senior FAO official and, by the time he reached the organisation’s headquarters, had changed his mind, and no longer wanted the meeting. Meanwhile, livestock industry supporters had set up a rival organisation – the Livestock Global Alliance (LGA), whose declared first priority was “to advocate for the global public good dimension of livestock”. It also reportedly sought to “improve the image of the livestock sector, particularly in response to the FAO report on Livestock’s Long Shadow”. LGA meetings were attended by at least one FAO executive and, according to Wagyu, the group’s objective was to obtain financing for industry-friendly research that could be fed back into the FAO policy-making process to influence the developing scientific consensus. “Private companies wanted to finance the science to achieve more outcomes that were biased in the direction they wanted, and this happened,” said Wagyu. “All of a sudden the trickle of scientific studies going in the livestock industry’s direction exploded.” Criollo described some of the LGA proposals as “spin-off mechanisms from industry that tried to push for certain positions”, but he said that these had not affected FAO models or data outputs. Steinfeld, who attended some LGA meetings, said simply: “They discussed world domination. They discussed how everything could be brought into their fold and establish the World Bank and World Organisation for Animal Health as the true world guardians of livestock and everything else should disappear.” As well as advocacy, the counter-group’s modus operandi was messaging to change the narrative on livestock. “It was a lot about counteracting the so-called damage done by the Long Shadow, and the idea, of course, to write proposals that would be attractive to donors was also there,” he added. The LGA has since folded. How can methane emissions be falling if people are eating more meat? One of the greatest concerns for environmental scientists has been the progressively falling FAO estimate of livestock’s overall contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. The 18% number in 2006 was revised downwards to 14.5% in a follow-up paper, Tackling Climate Change Through Livestock, in 2013. It is now being revised downwards again to about 11.2% based on a new “Gleam 3.0” model. The issue is acutely important as the FAO will present a blueprint for pegging global temperature rises to 1.5C at the next Cop in November. The latest analysis assumes a 13% reduction in its estimate of livestock emissions – from 8.1bn tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2017 (using data from 2010) to 6.19bn tonnes in 2022 (using data from 2015). This seems counter-intuitive, given that during the same period, the FAO recorded a 39% increase in global meat production. Most of the 20 plus former and serving FAO officials and consultants spoken to in the research of this story denied that pressure from agribusiness or states had affected their estimates of livestock emissions. But nevertheless, they continued to cite 18% or 14.5% as their preferred figure. Many scientists plot farm emissions on a very different trajectory, with one recent study concluding that greenhouse gas emissions from animal products made up 20% of the global total. One recent paper by Matthew Hayek, the assistant professor in environmental sciences at New York University, said that the FAO’s use of emissions modeling – without using verifiable atmospheric data – could underestimate methane emissions from livestock by up to 47% in countries such as the US. “Models are only estimates that need to be constantly validated – and there’s been an alarming lack of validation over the now decades that this [FAO] research has been produced,” he said. Anne Mottet, the FAO’s livestock development officer, stressed that the changing figures reflected best practices and evolving methodologies, rather than an assumed cut in livestock numbers. “Livestock is part of the FAO’s strategy on climate change and we work with governments and farmers and industry on this programme as well,” she said. “We can’t ignore the main actors of the sector but there has been no particular pressure from them.” As the only body overseeing global agriculture, the FAO is walking a thin line on livestock emissions, with gale force headwinds from both sides ready to batter any politician that joins in. Although there is growing awareness of the impact that high meat and dairy consumption has on certain countries’ carbon footprints, politicians are, in the main, profoundly reluctant to tackle the issue, particularly in this era of culture wars. Reducing meat and dairy consumption – even by a small amount – is scientifically proven as an effective way to reduce emissions, but almost no government will include that as part of their environmental messaging. The Netherlands, one of the few countries to have bravely announced a livestock reduction plan (although officially to reduce nitrogen – rather than methane – emissions) has seen a huge political challenge from the rightwing Farmer’s Party as a result. The UN has struggled to incorporate the farming sector in its climate summits as well. Cop27 in Egypt saw the first ever food pavilion, and the first ever mention of food in the final statement, but, as George Monbiot, an outspoken critic on this issue, has pointed out, there has never been reference to “livestock reduction” in any of its texts. Monbiot noted: “In the 20 years to 2018, global meat consumption rose by 58% … An analysis by Our World in Data shows that even if greenhouse gas pollution from every other sector were eliminated today, by 2100 food production will, on its current trajectory, bust the global carbon budget two or three times over. This is largely because of animal farming, which accounts for 57% of greenhouse gases from the food system, though it provides just 18% of the calories.” The FAO did not respond to more than a dozen questions sent to it by the Guardian. But Hayek said that the Guardian’s investigation shed new light on a change in the FAO’s framing of livestock emissions after 2006 – into an “opportunity” for industry rather than a problem for the planet. He said: “The insertion of officials and donors into rigorous data-oriented research has a potentially biasing effect. My overriding concern is that people with contrary views might not be at this organisation any more, thanks to conflicts instigated by lobbies, countries and contributing parties.” Jennifer Jacquet, professor of environmental science at the University of Miami, added: “It’s a story as old as time, that the meat and dairy industry has enormous influence over the policy-making apparatus. It’s no coincidence that industry’s involvement has led to lower overall relative estimates of emissions for livestock. Industry was taken aback by Livestock’s Long Shadow. It caught them on the backfoot and they had to regroup, double down and figure out how to get control of the narrative – and over the science to some degree.” In her own research into how agribusiness reacted to Livestock’s Long Shadow, Jacquet found “clear evidence that the industry saw it as a threat and something that they needed to control. They call it ‘a major PR problem’. It set off an industry lobbying coalition somewhat comparable to the oil and gas industry’s efforts against the Kyoto Protocol, with an enormous amount of coordination aimed at infiltrating and controlling climate science and, moreover, our understanding of the problem.” It is often said that policymaking is like sausage production in that, however delicious the results, you wouldn’t want to see how they are made. But as the sacred cow of agribusiness prepares to belch again in the FAO’s forthcoming emissions report, its assemblage this time around looks set to provide the scientific community with more food for thought than usual.\n",

      "Text: The premise sounded like a rich person’s ethically suspect fever dream: a dinner structured around endangered foods, dubbed “the last supper”. But it wasn’t a scene out of The Menu, the movie where detestable foodies seek a once-in-a-lifetime experience steeped in privilege and exploitation. Instead of dining on obscure food on the brink of extinction, the “last supper” featured recognizable dishes – salmon, oysters, coffee, wine – that could drastically change or disappear in the coming years as the climate warms and brings more volatile weather. No one would eat a food to extinction at this latest iteration of the last supper, in a restaurant in Minneapolis, in late January, to make a point. The point could be made with foods familiar to us, because even those are at risk of devastation in the near future. “The reality is this is starting to play out right now,” said Sam Kass, the former White House chef and political adviser to President Barack Obama who hosts these events to drive home how food and agriculture are affected by the climate crisis. Kass first presented the dinner concept at Cop21, the global climate change convention, in 2015. He has since hosted them at Davos for the world economic forum and in cities across the US. The 28 January dinner hosted by Kass and the chef and TV personality Andrew Zimmern in Minneapolis should have been frigid: the midwestern state is typically covered in snow and blisteringly cold in January. The festival it was part of, the Great Northern, serves to embrace and celebrate winter. But this year, Minnesota has seen an abnormally warm winter. A recent sledding rally took place on cardboard because there was no snow. The festival includes a climate series to acknowledge not just a celebration of winter, but the work needed to preserve it. Marque Collins, the chef at Minneapolis’s Tullibee, created the menu, which read like a prix fixe you’d see throughout the US. Courses included Norwegian salmon, oysters, lamb, fingerling potatoes, sticky toffee pudding. “It’s not something from the polar ice caps,” Collins said. “We’re not doing exotic, crazy things here. These are things that are legitimately affected by what’s going on. The overall approachability of the menu is kind of the point.” At the dinners, Kass centers his narrative on three big foods: coffee, wine and chocolate. Among those three, “I got the whole room,” he said. All three pleasures could suffer from major crop loss with only slight warming, affecting livelihoods and ways of life. “It’s foods that we consume every single day and bring us a lot of joy, and for some, it’s a deep expression of their very core identity,” he said. “Our ability to pass down the quality of life that we have enjoyed is at severe risk.” Kass and Zimmern can list examples of the ways these changes are playing out now: decimated oysters in Apalachicola Bay, Florida, previously a haven for the shellfish. A massively bad year for Georgia peaches. A lack of perch for midwestern Friday fish fries, increasing costs for what was typically a cheap, easy meal. As these foods become more rare, Zimmern noted, they get more and more expensive, exacerbating inequalities. The future could look like Charlie and his grandparents in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, passing around a chocolate bar to share, he quipped. The dinner isn’t meant to depress diners, though. It’s meant to show both how food and agriculture are affected by climate change, but also how food systems, a major driver of climate change, can be adapted to stave off the most extreme outcomes and perhaps make a better world. Diners asked questions about how to be good consumers, where to invest their money to make a difference, what role they can play to help out – all part of the intent to focus on solutions after introducing the problems. One woman drove the point home succinctly, saying: “When we’re talking about species extinction, we’re talking about our extinction.” Several dozen people who paid nearly $300 per ticket won’t alone solve a climate crisis that threatens global food systems. The hosts stressed the importance of spreading the message, both to people they know and to policymakers. “I want people to send a note to every friend in their email address book and tell them that we are at an existential hinge point,” Zimmern said. “This is a crisis that we need to actually solve.” Amuse bouche: shrimp and salmon chips with Old Bay and dill A small jar of crispy salmon skin and shrimp chips introduced the idea that seafoods of all kinds are particularly at risk from the climate crisis. Waters are warming, sending animals in search of cooler waters. For US consumers, this means that some, like lobster, will swim farther north, toward Canada, affecting their cost and availability. Collins, the chef at Tullibee, chose to use salmon skin, made perfectly crunchy and seasoned, to also highlight how to use a piece of the food that’s often thrown away, a nod to a solution alongside the problem. First course: east coast oysters, west coast oysters and marinated mussel served in the shell with a spruce-tip ponzu and finger limes The delicious crunch and earthy taste of the first course highlighted the perils faced by mollusks in the wild. They’re not just good for food, though: oysters actually help clean the water they live in. Oysters that used to grow naturally in wild habitats have seen major threats to their existence, like overharvesting, disease and pollution. Efforts to restore these habitats and grow oysters via farming methods like aquaculture are underway. Oysters and other seafoods carry with them a part of history and culture, not to mention an economic impact, that is diminished when their availability falters. In places like Chesapeake Bay, which now has a massive oyster-restoration project, catching and shucking oysters is a way of life. Second course: Norwegian salmon with romesco sauce and confit fingerling potatoes The restaurant has a Nordic influence, much like the culture in Minnesota. Collins chose Norwegian salmon that’s farm-raised and sustainable. “I didn’t want to use exotic ingredients. I still want to be responsible,” he said. Warming waters and less snow have made the life of wild salmon much more difficult, affecting their ability to reproduce and our ability to eventually eat them. The salmon life cycle traverses both freshwater and oceans, and the habitats in both are hurting the fish. Ocean waters are warming. And it doesn’t snow as much and instead rains, leaving less snowpack for streams and rivers. Aquaculture programs, where salmon and other fish are grown in farms, now produce sustainable foods that can adapt to changing weather and environmental conditions. Collins’ romesco sauce includes another food under threat: almonds. Nuts and fruits need chilly overnight temperatures and are affected by warming. Some research has shown that these trees could see more insects that destroy crops because of higher temperatures. Long-term drought also makes nuts a more difficult crop, especially in California, where water scarcity is an immediate problem. Third course: Hidden Streams lamb with hand-harvested wild rice, fenugreek and coffee, pickled ramp vinaigrette and red wine lamb jus Collins could have made an entire menu based on fish, crustaceans and mollusks – many of them are under imminent threat, while most land animals typical of US menus are not. He included a dish, with lamb raised at a nearby farm, with accompanying foods threatened both locally and worldwide. Land animals may not be at high risk, but the foods they eat could be. Kass said larger-commodity crops, like wheat, corn and soybeans, would have broad impacts on the global food supply if they were to suffer even smaller shifts in crop viability than what seafood experiences. The dish featured wild rice, a foraged food that’s a cultural staple in Minnesota, and ramps, a wild onion, as a commentary on how wild, foraged foods could be threatened by shifting weather, warmer temperatures and over-foraging. Foods grown in the wild are at the whims of nature. The dish also includes two of the big three items that Kass uses to drive home the importance of stalling climate change: coffee and wine. Coffee needs a stable climate, with cool nights and warm days, he said. If the globe warms by 2C by 2050, half of the regions that grow coffee will no longer be suitable, he said. “I don’t know what life means without coffee,” he told the diners. Similarly, wine suffers when weather is volatile, as climate change makes it. Kass pointed out that wine growers in the iconic Champagne, France, region have been buying land in England in preparation for making wine there in the future, as parts of France grow too warm for certain varietals. Fourth course: coffee and chocolate sticky toffee pudding with pistachio hazelnut and vanilla chantilly The final course showcased several foods under threat in a small, tasty sticky toffee pudding, the last word of the last supper. Coffee and nuts, noted earlier in the dinner, featured in the toffee pudding and in a pressed wafer shaped like a leaf placed on top, made of pistachio and hazelnut. Collins said he wanted to use flour to note how staple crops like wheat, grown throughout the midwestern US, are part of the equation, too. Small declines in these staples bring the potential for economic shocks, higher food insecurity, migration changes and conflict, Kass said, and in that sense, they’re perhaps the biggest concern. Chocolate’s fate looks similar to coffee and wine: it has to be grown in specific areas, and warming could make those areas inhospitable to the plants that form the backbone of its economy and culture. Kass said the climate is on track to eliminate cacao tree production by 2050 if nothing changes. Chocolate production is concentrated near the equator, largely by small farmers whose work is a way of life. Eating a chocolate bar or drinking a cup of coffee isn’t what’s driving the problem. “It’s the fact that because of the rest of our human behavior and activity on planet Earth, that is now under dire threat in a way that nobody realizes,” Kass said.\n",

      "Text: Sir David Attenborough has warned that humankind has the power to exterminate whole ecosystems “without even noticing”, and urged world leaders to treat the natural world with respect, during an interview with Prince William in Davos. Prince William also took world leaders to task at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, asking Attenborough why those in key positions have “taken so long” to address climate change. Attenborough said the connection between the natural world and urban societies had been “remote and widening” since the industrial revolution, meaning humans do not realise the effect their actions have on the global ecosystem. The 92-year-old broadcaster added that it was “difficult to overstate” the urgency of the environmental crisis. “We’re now so numerous, so powerful, so all-pervasive, the mechanisms we have for destruction are so wholesale and so frightening, that we can actually exterminate whole ecosystems without even noticing it. We have to now be really aware of the dangers of what we’re doing, and we already know that of course the plastic problem in the seas is wreaking appalling damage upon marine life, the extent of which we don’t yet fully know.” He stressed that the natural world “is not just a matter of beauty, interest and wonder” but a coherent ecosystem on which we depend for “every breath we take, every mouthful of food we take.” A healthy planet, Attenborough added, is an essential part of human life. “If we don’t recognise the kind of connections I’ve been describing, then the whole planet comes in hazard, and we are destroying the natural world and with it ourselves.” William pressed Attenborough for a key message for the politicians and business leaders gathered in Davos this week. “Care for the natural world. Not only care for the natural world but treat it with a degree of respect and reverence,” Attenborough said, adding that there was a worrying tendency to waste resources. “The thing that I really care for in our ordinary daily lives is not to waste the riches of the natural world on which we depend. And it’s not just energy ,which of course is very important, but it’s also dealing with the natural world with a degree of respect. Not to throw away food, not to throw away power – just care for the natural world of which you’re an essential part.” The Duke of Cambridge started and ended the session by congratulating Attenborough for winning the Crystal award, which recognises individuals who have helped make the world a better place, at the World Economic Forum on Monday night. William added it was a “personal treat” to be asking Attenborough questions, and quipped that it was a good change of pace from being the subject of interviews himself. Asking why global leaders have taken so long to react to climate change, William said: ““Why do you think world leaders and those in key positions of leadership; why do think they’ve taken so long … there have been quite a few faltering steps to act on environmental challenges?” Comparisons were also drawn between the broadcaster’s burgeoning BBC career in the 1950s, compared with his latest project that sees him team up with Netflix and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) for an upcoming series called “Our Planet” to be released on the online TV streaming site. Attenborough said his early work in the mid-1950s involved himself, one camera and one cameraman, and it was relatively “easy” to impress Britons simply by televising an armadillo. Now the systems are “unbelievable”, taking viewers to the sky and depths of the ocean in ways that 50 years ago, “people couldn’t imagine”. Prince William noted Attenborough’s late shift to environmental activism, noting that for many years the presenter “held back from speaking publicly about environmental issues”. Attenborough said that at the start of his career, it was nearly inconceivable that the environment would be in such a state of crisis and even pockets of animal extinction seemed like the exception rather than the norm. “To be truthful I don’t think there was anyone in the mid-50s who thought there was a danger that we would annihilate parts of the natural world. There were animals that were in danger, that’s true and there were animals that we could see if we didn’t do something they were going to become extinct. “And the notion that human beings might exterminate a whole species … you just hadn’t thought about it,” he said. “Now of course we’re only too well aware that the whole of the natural world is at our disposal, as it were. We can do things accidentally that exterminate a whole area of the natural world and species that live within it.”\n",

      "Text: People who live near fracking wells, wind turbines and solar farms should receive much more money for putting up with them in Britain's national interest, a senior Tory MP has said. Tim Yeo, the chairman of the energy select committee, said communities should get \"significant cash\" in return for any problems as new energy installations change the UK's landscape. Ministers have proposed £100,000 payments for communities affected by fracking, plus 1% of the revenues if the exploration is successful. People living near a medium-sized windfarm could also get in the region of £100,000. Yeo, however, called for higher incentives and said the cash should go directly to neighbourhoods most affected. \"I think the important thing here … is that local communities should be enabled to share in the benefits much more substantially than they can at the moment,\" he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"I think a significant cash benefit has to flow back to local communities if they're willing to accept – whether it's fracking or it's a solar farm, whether it's a wind turbine – that they're willing to accept those in the national interest as part of our national energy mix, they should share in the rewards. \"Cash benefits to the local communities, not some vague payment to the county council which people will see disappearing to a car park in the next town, but some of it [going] directly back to the people who live in the villages most affected.\" Yeo has temporarily stepped aside from his role as energy committee chairman following allegations that he used his position to help a business colleague. He denies the claims, but has referred himself to the parliamentary standards commissioner and stepped aside while the watchdog carries out an inquiry. He spoke out on the issue of community benefits on Friday after anti-fracking protests stopped exploratory drilling at a site in West Sussex. Ministers believe that exploiting Britain's vast reserves of shale gas could boost the economy and reduce energy prices, but critics are concerned that environmental damage could be caused by the technique, which involves pumping water and chemicals into the ground to break up rock and release gas. Yeo said he would \"rather that we used gas that was produced in this country than bought from the Middle East or even from Norway\", but it would have to be properly regulated and come with good compensation deals. Several Conservative and Labour MPs whose constituencies could be affected by fracking have also called for more substantial compensation. Eric Ollerenshaw, the Tory MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood, told the Financial Times this week: \"We are trying to get the best deal we can for our constituents whatever political side they are on. We don't want the crumbs off the table. We want to make sure we get something out of this for the long term for Lancashire as a whole.\"\n",

      "Text: US and UK financial institutions have been among the leading investors in Russian “carbon bomb” fossil fuel projects, according to a new database of holdings from recent years. Campaigners in Ukraine said these institutions must immediately end such investments, to limit the funding of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and to avoid climate breakdown. Carbon bombs are fossil-fuel extraction projects identified by researchers to contain at least 1bn tonnes of climate-heating CO2, triple the UK’s annual emissions. Russia is a hotspot, with 40 carbon bombs, 19 of them operated or developed by Russian companies backed by foreign finance. The companies are Gazprom, Novatek, Lukoil, Rosneft oil company and Tatneft. The database, produced by the Leave it in the Ground Initiative (Lingo), found more than 400 foreign financial institutions had provided $130bn (£109bn) of support to the Russian companies – $52bn in investment and $84bn in credit. The data was released on Wednesday, Ukraine’s independence day and six months since the start of the Russian invasion. Financial institutions in the US hold almost half the foreign investment in Russian carbon bomb companies, with 154 institutions holding $23.6bn. The largest combination of investment and credit – $10bn – was provided by JPMorgan Chase, which other analyses have also identified as a leading funder of fossil fuels. The biggest single investment in the Russian carbon bomb companies was the $15.3bn in Rosneft held by the Qatar Investment Authority, Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund. The UK was third in the list of investing nations, with 32 financial institutions holding $2.5bn in investments. HSBC had the largest investment and credit total, at $308m. Financial groups in Japan, Norway, Switzerland and the Netherlands also held significant investments, while Chinese and Italian institutions provided $45bn in credit between them. “Putin’s war is funded through money from fossil fuels and these fossil fuels are causing climate breakdown as we speak,” said Svitlana Romanko, director of the Ukrainian NGO Razom We Stand, which is calling for an immediate end to all foreign investment in Russian fossil fuel companies and a permanent embargo on Russian oil, gas and coal. “Investing in Russian carbon bombs is the worst thing you can do today.” Kjell Kühne, at Lingo, said: “This [war] has made really clear that, when you don’t care who you’re doing business with, it does translate into human suffering and lives lost. It’s also clear we should not be investing in new fossil fuel projects, as the International Energy Agency has confirmed. Anybody involved in these projects should be really questioning what they’re doing.” The Lingo researchers said some financial institutions may have reduced their support for the Russian companies since the war started, but that many seemed to have adopted a wait-and-see approach. The researchers hope the database will enable campaigners to challenge the 400 institutions over their investments. The foreign financial support is largely for big oil and gas projects in Russia, including in Siberia and the Arctic. Coal projects are mainly supported by domestic investors, the researchers said. The database only includes financial support for the Russian fossil fuel companies and not for foreign oil and gas companies that work in Russia, or the services companies that support them. In May, the Guardian revealed that world’s biggest fossil fuel firms were quietly planning huge oil and gas projects that would drive the climate past internationally agreed temperature limits, with catastrophic global impacts. The plans included 195 carbon bombs identified by Kühne and his colleagues, 60% of which have already started pumping. “We have identified the carbon bombs, now we have to defuse them,” he said. A spokeswoman for HSBC said: “HSBC Asset Management has suspended dealings in its Russia-only funds which include the Russian oil and gas companies referenced and [is] no longer investing further in funds whose objectives included investing in Russian securities. In these funds, exposure to Russian equities has generally been reduced or exited.” JPMorgan Chase and the Qatar Investment Authority have also been contacted for comment.\n",

      "Text: As corporate reports go, the title of Aussie tech firm Atlassian’s guide for other companies to cut their greenhouse gas emissions is as direct and flavoursome as they come: “Don’t F&*! The Planet.” The firm, founded by Australians Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar, says it is already running its operations on 100% renewable electricity and has a “science-based target” to reach net zero emissions no later than 2040. But the guide lays out the company’s steps in adopting its target and warns companies that the issue of using offsets to meet targets “is facing an enormous amount of blowback”. The guide says any company that commits to a science-based target “can’t make net zero claims” until they have cut their emissions directly by 90%, with carbon offsets used to make up the balance. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup One analysis says about one-third of the world’s biggest publicly traded companies have net zero goals. A UN expert group has said offsets should only be used once companies have worked to cut their direct emissions. Atlassian head of sustainability, Jess Hyman, said: “It’s not enough for us to move on our own, we have to do it in lockstep with other big business. “We saw the business risk and, frankly, the very real opportunity side of going after it. We need to be really clear that this is about long-term success.” Consumers had high expectations and whole supply chains also needed to be engaged to bring emissions down. Worldwide, Hyman said regulators were making it clear that climate disclosures will be a requirement of doing business. She said: “It’s become a question of: how quick are you going to push, are you going to capture first-mover advantage? “The pressure is just too great at this point, as we near the point of peak emissions, to kick the can down the road.” Atlassian was the first large Australian tech firm to join RE100 in 2019, a global group of companies aiming for 100% renewable energy use. There is a need to set “ruthless” priorities, which for Atlassian meant starting with a science-based target, Hyman said. Atlassian’s new Sydney headquarters will be in the world’s tallest “hybrid timber tower” that claims to have 50% less CO2 emissions related to construction than conventional towers. As more people work from home, the company’s emissions must also take other locations into account. The guide tracks Atlassian’s progress and draws on more than 100 conversations with peer companies, including Australia’s Canva and other tech firms balancing rapid growth and net zero goals. “We’ve been talking about how these goals are completely impossible alone and possible together,” Hyman said. But there’s no one-size-fits-all approach as every company is urged to understand their own emissions profile. She recommended starting with a target for emissions reduction, getting it independently checked, and then reporting on progress. “And I caution people from setting a goal if they don’t have a plan to really do the work. You have to do both and you need to anticipate that your stakeholders are going to hold you to it.”\n",

      "Text: They are one of the world’s worst invasive species, and now, more than two decades after they are believed to have arrived in Australia, the country is launching the second-biggest biosecurity operation in its history to eradicate red imported fire ants. State, territory and federal agricultural ministers met in Melbourne on Wednesday and agreed to spend $411.4m over the next 10 years, endorsing a biosecurity operation second only in size and ambition to the country’s successful eradication of bovine tuberculosis, which started in the 1970 and took nearly three decades. The eradication effort has been spearheaded by an unlikely alliance of environmentalists and farmers, who are equally concerned about the devastating effects the ants would have on Australia’s lifestyle, economy and environment if they become established. First detected in Australia in 2001, but probably brought in years earlier, the South American “red imported fire ants” are thought to have caused dozens of deaths in the United States, where they have become established and cost the economy $7bn a year. In Australia seven separate incursions have been recorded – four in Brisbane, two elsewhere in Queensland and one in Sydney – with time-limited and underfunded control programs managing to eradicate all but one incursion. The one incursion remaining – in the suburbs of Brisbane – was first observed in 2001, although according to experts, was probably present up to ten years earlier. Without a major eradication push, experts say outbreaks will spread and lead to an uncontrolled and established population that will change Australia forever. According to the an independent review conducted for the federal government, it would have a bigger impact than rabbits, cane toads, foxes, camels, wild dogs and feral cats combined. “If Australia fails to eradicate fire ants almost no corner of the continent will be safe from these menacing predators,” said the chief executive of the Invasive Species Council, Andrew Cox. Ben Hoffman, an exotic ant specialist at the CSIRO in Darwin, agreed. “This species is ranked as one of the worst invasive species in the world for very good reason,” he said. “You only need to look to the United States to see what would happen here.” The ants are extremely aggressive, attacking en masse and inflicting an itching and burning sting that can last an hour. Secondary infections from the stings can be serious, and in rare cases allergic reactions have killed people. The Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (QDAF) describe the species as a “social menace”. “Encounters with fire ants usually involve dozens of ants moving quickly and undetected. By the time they sting, a large number of ants could be on your body, all stinging at once. Stings from fire ants can cause a painful, burning itching sensation, which can last for up to an hour. Multiple stings give the sensation that the body is on fire.” Modelling conducted by the CSIRO has shown the ants, if established, could infest every state and territory in Australia, with prime habitats extending all the way around the coast and throughout the tropical north. Experience from the US shows people’s lives can be severely affected. When that happens, “people do not have picnics on the lawn, go barefoot or sit or lie on the ground, or even stand for too long in one spot because they will be stung”, warned QDAF. The ants can also have severe environmental and economic impacts. One study estimated fire ants could cost $45bn over 30 years in south-east Queensland alone. The ants have the potential to eradicate some native animals, feeding voraciously on them. Since fire ants also eat seeds and pollinating animals and undermine root systems, they could cause major changes to entire ecosystems. That would damage world heritage sites, hurt tourism and cost the beef and cattle industry $308m a year in production losses and control costs – cutting margins of farmers by 40%. In May, the National Farmers’ Federation, Queensland’s farming lobby group AgForce and local government groups joined the Invasive Species Council, signing an open letter calling for a major eradication push. “This aggressive stinging ant is a major threat to the survival of young calves and cattle in south-east Queensland,” said Charles Burke, the then chief executive of CEO AgForce. “Human lifestyles and farming procedures would change forever if red imported fire ants are not eradicated.” Cox said: “Fire ants can rapidly expand in numbers and have the potential to invade more than 99% of the nation. Once out of control, fire ants would threaten every aspect of Australian life, including our farming communities, schools, sports grounds, tourism industries and unique natural heritage.” According to all available analyses, the $38m per year eradication program agreed to on Wednesday is predicted to have a huge cost-benefit ratio. Every dollar invested is expected to pay back at least $25 of avoided costs – with the government’s independent review finding that was likely an underestimation. The government’s independent review concluded a program that spent $38m a year for 10 years had a 95% chance of successfully eradicating the ants from Australia. Hoffman said Australia had become a world leader in fire-ant eradication. Of the five successful eradications that have occurred, one of them in Gladstone is already the largest ant eradication for any species in the world. “What’s been achieved is the absolute gold standard,” he said. “What’s left is the largest population of a single incursion. It’s still highly ambitious but it’s the closest anyone has been to eradicating the ant after it’s been established anywhere in the world.” He said the lessons learned in the eradications so far – and the successful containment of the continued incursion in Brisbane – needed to be applied and scaled up to eradicate the country of the pests. “Theoretically, if it’s resourced appropriately, it can be achieved because we’ve done it so many times already just on smaller scales.” With that money, an independent taskforce will be set up, and a veritable war waged on the insects, beginning in September. About $24m will be spent each year on baiting, aircraft hire for aerial bait bombing, direct injection of bait into nests, field staff and remote sensing including cameras, more aircraft and all-terrain vehicles. A further $14m will be spent each year on other eradication activities including community engagement, research, movement controls and odour detection dogs. Cox said the funding had put Australia on a “war footing”. “Our fire ant fighters have finally been given the war chest they need to eradicate deadly fire ants from Australia,” he said. Both Cox and Hoffman said eradication was a huge effort, but just as important would be improved biosecurity to avoid further incursions. “We’ve been getting one new outbreak of fire ants every year until this year,” said Cox. “We have to beef up our biosecurity efforts to make sure we don’t undermine all of that investment. “This is a huge achievement and shows a clear resolve from all governments and political parties. No one in the world has attempted anything like this.”\n",

      "Text: Green energy accounted for more than half of net electricity generation capacity added around the world last year for the first time, leading energy experts have found. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said the milestone was evidence of a rapid transformation in energy taking place, and predicted capacity from renewable sources will grow faster than oil, gas, coal or nuclear power in the next five years. But the analysts said the outlook in the UK has deteriorated since the Conservative government took power last year and cut support for wind and solar power. The agency’s chief said Britain had huge renewable energy potential and ministers needed to design stronger policies to exploit it. “What I see is we are witnessing the transformation of energy system markets led by renewables and this is happening very quickly,” said Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA. “This transformation and the growth of renewables is led by the emerging countries in the years to come, rather than the industrialised countries.” China will lead the world for growth in renewable power, followed by the US and Europe, a new report by the agency found. The IEA said the EU was relinquishing its position as a renewable energy pioneer due to weak electricity demand and policy uncertainty, which Birol warned could see European renewable energy manufacturers lose out to international rivals. “If you think of running a marathon, Europe started with a big advance, more than half of the marathon they are leading by far. They are now getting a bit tired, and some others are overtaking Europe slowly but surely,” he told the Guardian. The IEA said Asia will be the “engine of growth”, led by China and India. “China is a completely separate chapter,” said Birol. “China alone is responsible for about 40% of growth in the next five years. When people talk about China, they think about coal, but it is changing.” A total of 153GW of net renewable electricity capacity was installed globally in 2015, a record high, equivalent to Canada’s capacity and up 15% on the year before. Net capacity is new capacity minus retired capacity, such as old hydro being taken offline. China is expected to add a further 305GW over the next five years, followed by India with 76GW. Onshore windfarms and solar power led the charge last year, with 63GW and 49GW of new global capacity respectively. The two technologies are also forecast to take the lion’s share of growth, with electricity generation from solar tripling and wind doubling. Their costs are expected to continue the dramatic and unprecedented reductions in recent years, with onshore wind coming down a further 15% and big solar 25% by 2021. “The cost of wind dropped by about one third in the last five to six years, and that of solar dropped by 80%,” said Birol, adding that while the cost of gas had also fallen recently, it was not at the same speed that green energy had become cheaper. “The decline in renewables [cost] was very sharp and in a very short period of time. This is unprecedented.” While renewables now account for more than 50% of net capacity additions and are expected by the IEA to reach around 60% by 2021, they still provide a relatively small share of the world’s electricity. Green sources are only expected to provide 28% of electricity generation by 2021, up from 23% in 2015, and much of that will be from existing hydropower dams. Renewable energy is seen by scores of countries as a key way to meet climate targets that they pledged under the Paris agreement, which comes into force in November. But even with the huge growth expected in coming years, the IEA said it will not be sufficient to meet the Paris deal’s target of keeping temperatures below 2C, the threshold for dangerous warming. “No, it’s by far not enough [the trajectory of growth],” said Birol. The agency painted a gloomy picture of solar and onshore wind’s prospects in the UK, echoing recent warnings from other respected energy authorities. “The policy landscape for renewables has become more challenging since the 2015 general election,” the report said. Since coming to power, the Conservatives have drastically cut or ended subsidies for wind and solar power, begun the privatisation of the green bank which supports clean energy, and enthusiastically backed fracking for shale gas and new nuclear. “While government support for new gas and nuclear capacity is evident, recent policy changes indicate that the role envisioned for renewables is uncertain,” the IEA said. “There is need in the UK to invest in stronger renewable policies,” said Birol. “The potential is huge compared to what we are expecting.” The agency’s chief said that contrary to what renewable energy critics argued, the biggest threat to the technologies was not their intermittent nature but the intermittency of governments’ support. “The issue is not the predictability of solar and wind, it is the predictability of government policies because investors need to see what their prospects are. This is the main challenge I see in the renewable energy sector.” Imke Lübbeke, head of climate and energy at WWF’s European policy office, said: “The IEA report clearly shows that president [Jean-Claude] Juncker’s promise to make the EU ‘the world leader in renewables’ remains empty rhetoric. Instead, the European Union is losing its leadership role to the US and China.”\n",

      "Text: Fossil fuel companies must pay tens of billions to reduce the emissions of methane from their operations or it will be almost impossible to meet global climate targets, the world’s energy watchdog has warned. The US is now the biggest source of methane emissions from oil and gas extraction, as a result of the massive expansion of its oil and gas sector, while China is the biggest emitter of methane from coal mining. Russia also continues to be a major emitter as its fossil fuel operations are poorly run. Leaks from coalmines and oil and gas wells are the biggest sources of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that has caused about 30% of the temperature increases seen to date, according to data published on Wednesday by the International Energy Agency (IEA). About 170bn cubic metres of methane was emitted from fossil fuel operations around the world last year, which is more than the entire natural gas production of Qatar. Yet many of these leaks could easily be plugged if the best practices developed in some countries – such as Norway, which has low methane leaks from its oil and gas drilling operations – were adopted around the world. Currently, the least efficient operations are about 100 times worse than the most efficient, with Turkmenistan and Venezuela the worst offenders. One well blowout in Kazakhstan last year produced large quantities of methane for more than 200 days. The IEA calculated, in a global survey of methane published on Wednesday, that $170bn would be needed to reduce global methane emissions by 75%, of which $100bn was needed in oil and gas and $70bn in the coal industry. That would give the world a much-improved chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, the report found. The spending required from fossil fuel companies to clean up their operations would be the equivalent of about 5% of the enormous profits they made last year, the IEA estimated. Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser now with American University in Washington, said the US must ensure all producers followed best practice. “Now that the US is the world’s largest producer of oil and gas, its industry must finally commit to near-zero methane emissions by the end of this decade, even as the Biden administration regulates methane more strictly, or face a consumer backlash,” he warned. “At the same time, Russia continues to have the highest rate of methane leakage, another reason for the EU and others to continue boycotting the gas that is funding Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. And China must shut down many of its coalmines, as methane adds to CO2 to produce the most greenhouse gas-heavy fossil fuel in the world.” Despite a pledge of action on methane from more than 200 countries, emissions of the gas remained near to the record high set in 2019, according to the IEA report. The energy adviser’s Global Methane Tracker also found that real world emissions were far higher than countries or companies were reporting. There were reasons to be optimistic, however, the authors of the IEA report said. Better monitoring of methane emissions is now possible, from satellites, and is set to improve further with the launch of a dedicated methane satellite system from the US NGO Environmental Defense Fund. “Sometimes it can be quite quick and easy to stop [leaks once identified],” said Christophe McGlade, head of the energy supply unit at the IEA. “We hope the UN can pick this [satellite data] up and use it.” Tim Gould, co-author of the IEA report, said the forthcoming Cop29 UN climate summit, scheduled to take place in Azerbaijan this November, could provide an opportunity for governments and companies to take stronger action. “Cop29 will take place in a large oil and gas producer – that will help to keep the focus on methane,” he said. “We would also like to see a focus on methane in countries’ NDCS [their nationally determined contributions, or plans under the Paris agreement to cut emissions].” Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, called on governments to heed the IEA’s advice. “Cutting methane is the only way to slow near-term warming and avoid the tipping points that send us into irreversible and catastrophic climate chaos. It’s the blowtorch that’s setting the climate on the boil. Turn it off and the temperature goes down faster than anything we can do,” he said.\n",

      "Text: African countries should be able to exploit their vast natural gas reserves despite the urgent need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions, the former UN climate envoy Mary Robinson has said. Robinson, the chair of the Elders group of former world statespeople and business leaders, said African countries’ need for energy was so great that they should use gas widely, in contrast to developed countries that must halt their gas use as quickly as possible to stave off climate breakdown. “Africa is trying to get its voice out about its needs for just, equitable energy, and of course that implies some use of gas as a just transition,” she told the Guardian in an interview. She pointed to the 600 million people in Africa without access to electricity and the 900 million who use biomass or dirty oil cooking stoves, who could use gas as a less polluting alternative. “There has to be a certain leeway to tackle the energy poverty in Africa, and give Africa a faster capability to move,” she said. African leaders will bring forward similar arguments ahead of Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh in November, which is certain to make the issue a flashpoint at the UN climate summit that is seen as a chance for African countries to gain global attention for their vulnerability to the climate crisis, and their economic potential. Robinson’s intervention is likely to inflame controversy after two weeks of UN preparatory talks for Cop27 convened in Bonn, Germany, from Monday. While some back the idea that African gas can be exploited while the EU and developed countries find green alternatives, others see an African dash for gas as a potential disaster. With gas prices high and likely to remain so, and with most of Africa’s potential reserves owned or licensed by foreign companies, it would be difficult to keep African gas on the continent, rather than sold to the highest bidder. Thuli Makama, the Africa programme director at the campaign group Oil Change International, said: “Africa should not be pressured to exploit fossil fuel reserves to serve the international community in the face of Russia’s unprovoked war, and Africa does not need to develop these reserves to meet its energy access needs. It’s a myth that fossil fuels are good for development.” African countries are also unhappy that developed countries have exploited their own gas and are now seeking new sources because of soaring prices and supply constraints following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Africa has major gas reserves in countries including Nigeria, Mozambique and Senegal but many are still largely unexploited. Mohamed Maait, Egypt’s finance minister, made the argument last month on a visit to London. He warned rich countries not to appear to “punish” the poor world and gave the example of Senegal, where major gas discoveries are expected that could transform the economy – but would also constitute a vast “carbon bomb” of the kind that if exploited would lead to temperature rises far exceeding the 1.5C limit targeted in Glasgow. “Senegal were hoping this discovery would help them. Now you are coming to say, climate change means stopping the finance,” said Maait. “That is very worrying.” Urging Africa to drill for gas marks a change of heart for Robinson, who before last year’s Cop26 summit heavily criticised the UK government for its involvement in financing a new gasfield in Mozambique. She also called the UK’s tax breaks for North Sea oil and gas “a form of madness”. Robinson, the former president of Ireland and an influential figure in global climate diplomacy, acknowledged she had been very reluctant to encourage fresh exploitation of gas, but Africa’s energy poverty was so great that the transition to gas was needed. “Some people think it’s a dangerous message,” she said. “You can see my dilemma. I’m utterly committed to [climate action], I couldn’t be more on-message about how serious that is. But it’s not a one size fits all.” The International Energy Agency has warned that no new oil and gas should come onstream in future if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The Guardian has uncovered nearly 200 carbon bombs, a significant number of them in Africa, representing oil and gas deposits that if exploited would result in greenhouse gas emissions going far beyond 1.5C or 2C of heating. “If we had done the right thing and invested in clean energy for African companies at scale, we would be in a different place, but we haven’t done that,” said Robinson. “And now we have to understand that African countries are hit by the climate crisis disproportionately.” She said European countries and the US, which are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels, had no basis on which to advise African countries to leave their reserves alone. However, Jamie Peters, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “Fossil fuel extraction hasn’t brought prosperity for the vast majority of Africans and further developments will only bring more damage. There needs to be a rapid move to develop clean energy systems in Africa to provide energy security and much-needed jobs – and this should be funded by the rich, industrialised nations that have done most to create the climate crisis.”\n",

      "Text: When you’re in a bit of a tight hole, it’s quite good advice to first stop digging while you work out how to climb out. But over the past week, the advice from conservative commentators on tackling Australia’s rising energy prices while lowering emissions has been to keep digging (and drilling). In Sydney’s Daily Telegraph, columnist Erin Molan turned the caps lock on to declare “WE NEED COAL”. It’s tempting to respond with “NO WE DON’T” and leave it at that. But there are certain expectations from a fact-checking column. Molan argued clean and renewable alternatives to fossil fuels with the “infrastructure in place” to support them did not currently exist. Let’s test that. Alison Reeve, an energy and climate expert at the Grattan Institute, said in the electricity market “coal has been doing two things”. “Providing electrons and system stability. The renewables can substitute the electrons and we can use other things – like storage and demand management – to find system stability. “So you only need coal to the extent that you don’t have those other things lined up yet.” She said while there were legitimate concerns about the pace that storage and other measures were being added, “that’s not a case for keeping coal”. The Australian Energy Market Operator’s blueprint for the expected future of the electricity market – a plan released after consulting more than 15,000 analysts and stakeholders – also disagrees with Molan. That plan includes several scenarios for the future, but the one Aemo says experts think is most likely sees 60% of coal generating capacity gone by 2030. Why? “Competition, climate change and operational pressures will intensify [for coal] with the ever-increasing penetration of firmed renewable generation,” the plan says. Oh yes, climate change. Burning coal is the biggest single contributor to the climate emergency. Since Aemo’s blueprint was released in late June, both the Queensland and Victoria state governments have announced major energy plans mapping the exit route for coal that are broadly in line with Aemo’s plans. Neither state sees a future in burning coal, with the polluting fuel practically gone in both states by 2035. Coalmining is also responsible for about one fifth of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions from methane, according to official figures. The actual number, according to data from the International Energy Agency, could be double that. As the Albanese government this week signed a global pledge to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030, mining more coal will make those targets – nonbinding, but geopolitically significant – harder to reach. Molan claimed in her column there was “ample evidence in recent years of times and occasions when renewables just haven’t been able to supply our energy needs”, but didn’t actually offer any evidence. This is a strange interpretation of how the electricity market works. Reeve was puzzled. “It’s a mixed system and you will always have the generation you need to meet the demand. “The percentage provided by renewables fluctuates, but I’m not aware of any time where we have had a blackout because renewable energy hasn’t supplied sufficient electricity.” Even before Russia invaded Ukraine, international gas prices were pushing up the cost of gas and electricity in Australia. In the Australian Financial Review, Indigenous business figure and failed Liberal candidate Warren Mundine offered his own solution to rising gas prices. “There’s a very simple way to reduce natural gas prices. Drill more gas. It doesn’t require governments spending billions of dollars; they just have to get out of the way and allow gas exploration,” Mundine wrote. Australia does not have a shortage of gas. According to the government’s figures, some 75% of all the gas produced in Australia is exported as LNG (if you count the gas burned in the process of compressing gas to LNG, this overall figure rises to 82%). “Let’s think this through,” says Reeve. “Say we drill for more gas. International prices are very high, so that gas is sold overseas and we continue to pay high prices. It’s not actually a solution.” Reeve says the cost of energy in Australia is strongly linked to the international price of gas and coal. “Those commodities are suffering a lot of price volatility,” she says. “So long term, if you want to insulate yourself from the impacts of wars overseas and what they do to commodity markets, then you try and have as little coal and gas in your system as possible.” What seems odd here is the open advocacy for the very same fuels that are behind two of the country’s greatest challenges: sharply rising electricity prices and the climate crisis. Gas and coal are the problem, not the solution. In the middle of a rant about how climate activists who like to throw food at artworks and stick themselves to pavements are really just “bullies”, Sky News Australia host Andrew Bolt this week referred to the Swedish teenage climate campaigner that conservatives love to hate. “Teenager Greta Thunberg is another catastrophist, with one Swedish church even anointing her as a successor to Jesus Christ,” said Bolt. This claimed anointing never happened. The basis for the claim was a 2018 tweet from a parish church in Sweden, for which the church apologised soon after.\n",

      "Text: Approving a new deep coalmine in Cumbria would stifle international efforts to decarbonise industry and could produce a chain-reaction effect boosting prospective overseas mining projects, the public inquiry into the UK scheme has heard. Boris Johnson’s aspirations to cast his government as an international climate leader at the upcoming Cop26 summit would be fatally undermined, the inquiry’s closing session also heard, if the mine were given the green light by the Planning Inspectorate. Paul Brown, the counsel acting for Friends of the Earth at the inquiry, said such a decision “would fundamentally undermine any credibility this government has on the world stage”. “Instead of being a world leader, we would be seen as the worst hypocrite imaginable,” he argued as part of his closing remarks, adding that the UK would lose any authority in its attempts to persuade developing countries to abandon similar fossil fuel schemes. The impact of this decision on years of gradual gains in international negotiations could be devastating, he said. His comments came as the parties giving evidence at the inquiry pressed their final cases to the Planning Inspectorate. A final site visit along the Cumbrian coast, near Whitehaven, will take place early next week, with the door left open for final written details to be collected over a number of days thereafter. The decision will then go to Michael Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, who will have the ultimate say. A wide-ranging and at certain points heated inquiry has in its final days heard representations addressing carbon offsetting proposals, possible wildlife impacts the mine is expected to bring and the sulphur content of the 2.7m tonnes of coal West Cumbria Mining (WCM) plans to extract annually. With the UK hosting the Cop26 summit in just four weeks’ time, climate scientists giving evidence at the inquiry have stressed the need for ambitious emissions targets set by Johnson’s administration to be met, while arguing the mine would make a mockery of any subsequent attempts to position his government as an international climate leader. Prof Rebecca Willis, from Lancaster University, said: “West Cumbria Mining claims the planning inspector should ignore the carbon emissions that come from burning the coal from the mine. “But the climate won’t ignore these emissions. The UK has a legal commitment to far-reaching climate action, and this mine takes us in exactly the wrong direction.” The question of “end use” emissions – whether the carbon emissions produced by the combustion of the coal in blastfurnaces are factored in by the Planning Inspectorate – is thought to be key to the outcome in this regard. Local supporters of WCM’s project remain confident the proposals will pass through this final planning stage. They are urging Gove to make a swift decision once the report is published, which they hope will be by the end of the year. Amid concerns WCM’s financial backers may pull out of the venture, they point to a delay of more than 18 months before Gove’s predecessor, Robert Jenrick, ruled in autumn 2020 on an opencast coalmine application in Northumberland. The Copeland borough mayor, Mike Starkie, said: “The planning inspector has heard essentially what the [local authority] planning panels heard on three occasions. “I now expect the Planning Inspectorate will make the recommendation to government that the project should go ahead. And then hopefully we can put this sorry saga of protest behind us, get a shovel in the ground and get on with this mine.” Mark Jenkinson, the MP for neighbouring Workington, said: “We’ll soon have Cop26 – which, frankly, has been a distraction and has led the debate in unhelpful directions at times – out of the way with. “I hope the inquiry has given us the chance to have a rational, fact-based conversation around the mine. And I would urge the secretary of state to make a decision as quickly as possible once the planning inspector publishes his report.” The Liberal Democrat MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale, Tim Farron, has written to ministers this week regarding the proposed introduction of a traffic light system as stringent as the one required for fracking, should the mine be approved, in light of the site’s proximity to the Sellafield nuclear facility. Farron is now the only non-Conservative MP in Cumbria and, along with the Penrith MP, Dr Neil Hudson, who changed his position on the eve of inquiry, one of only two opposed to the coalmine in the county. He told the Guardian the scheme “would be an environmental disaster”, adding that the only meaningful solution to the economic concerns raised by the project was to “pull the plug on the mine and instead invest in long-term renewable jobs for people in Cumbria”. WCM has been contacted for comment.\n",

      "Text: Wildlife species will die out and natural ecosystems collapse in the near future if the climate crisis goes unchecked, scientists have warned, as new research shows that the natural world is at far greater risk from climate breakdown than previously thought. Catastrophe could strike this decade for some species, as key temperature thresholds are crossed. Instead of the anticipated gradual decline of species, there are likely to be a series of sudden collapses. Ocean ecosystems will be first hit, as the seas have already warmed to an unprecedented extent, and problems such as lack of oxygen and an increase in acid worsen. By the 2040s, a similarly abrupt collapse is likely to spread to the land, causing devastation among key species in Indonesia, the Amazon, India, northern Australia and sub-Saharan Africa and the Congo rainforest. “It’s not a slippery slope, but a series of cliff edges, hitting different places at different times,” said Alex Pigot of University College London, lead author of the study, published today in the journal Nature. What appears to happen, according to the study’s authors, is that most species can cope with warming temperatures for a while. But when a certain temperature threshold is crossed, suddenly a large proportion of species face conditions they have not experienced before, and the ecosystem can abruptly collapse. The authors base their projections on dividing the globe into square cells of 100km by 100km, and within those cells studying the geographic ranges of more than 30,000 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and other animals and plants. They mapped this data against our knowledge of the climate from 1850 to 2005. Then they broke down climate predictions from now until 2100 on an annual basis, examining when the species in each grid cell were likely to experience temperatures higher than they had before. That showed a different picture than had been previously possible, by giving a slow-motion projection, a bit like a time-lapse photograph, at a very fine scale, of how species would react each year as their habitats warmed. “Despite many hundreds of studies looking at the impacts on biodiversity of climate change, this abrupt pattern [of collapse] hasn’t previously been detected, because most studies have focused on projections for one – or a few – snapshots of the future, say the year 2070 or 2100,” Pigot explained. “In our study, we instead quantified how the risks to biodiversity from climate change will change over time at annual resolutions.” The scientists found that, on average, 73% of the species facing unprecedented temperatures before 2100 will cross that threshold simultaneously. If global temperatures rise by 4C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, as they will if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, then at least 15% of ecosystems will have an “abrupt exposure event”, meaning more than one fifth of their constituent species will cross the threshold in the same decade, causing irreversible damage. But at less than 2C of warming, the limit set under the Paris agreement, only 2% of ecosystems will go through such abrupt change, sparing many of the species at risk from higher temperatures. That means taking urgent action on emissions could save tens of thousands of species by “flattening the curve” of the impact, and providing more time for species and ecosystems to adapt. “It is not too late to stop extinctions from climate change,” said Christopher Trisos, of the University of Cape Town, co-author of the three-year study. “Our research shows that rapid action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions this decade will effectively flatten the curve of species at risk. Similar to the Covid-19 pandemic, early action to limit the risk pays off in a big way. It does not eliminate all risk from climate change, but reduces the number of species and ecosystems exposed by a massive amount.” Scientists have known for years about the likely existence of “tipping points” in the world’s climate, when global heating triggers abrupt or self-reinforcing changes: for instance, the melting of the Arctic ice cap uncovers dark sea beneath, which absorbs more heat than the reflective ice and, in turn, results in more melting. This new paper is one of a growing body of research showing there could be similar tipping points in the natural world, related to climate breakdown. It adds to other studies that have shown the Amazon and other major rainforests are likely to turn from carbon sinks to carbon sources, and shown the extent to which the sea and land have already absorbed the impacts of global heating. Mark Wright, director of science at WWF-UK, said: “There is already more than enough evidence that climate change is impacting the natural world and that we risk losing up to a million species. We know what the solutions are to halt climate change and biodiversity loss. “The world is currently rightly focused on tackling the global health emergency. However, this new research reinforces that, after we are through this extremely difficult time, we will need renewed ambitious action to address the climate and nature crisis.”\n",

      "Text: George Monbiot (The end of nuclear power? Careful what you wish for, 5 February) slams Germany for increasing its CO2 emissions last year by 5% – but he fails to look at the bigger picture. Germany is embarking on a radical \"energy turnaround\". With such a massive project, some negative outcomes are to be expected while this huge ship changes course. However, if all goes to plan, Germany should become Europe's flagship for a new social framework which has energy sustainability at his core. And despite current emission levels, the country is still on track to reach its 80% carbon reduction target by 2050. Under massive popular pressure, the German government decided to end its nuclear programme on moral grounds: it was simply unethical to put its people under threat from a Fukushima-type disaster. It is now pouring billions into research and development of energy that is both renewable and safe. Meanwhile it is installing bridging technologies like combined heat and power to gradually reduce its carbon output. In other words, it has a clear roadmap. What do we have in the UK? A government that is blindly resurrecting dodgy old technologies like nuclear as well as introducing new horrors such as fracking. In times of great social upheaval we need leaders and commentators with their eyes firmly fixed on long-terms goals that are underpinned by strong ethical foundations.Camilla BerensKick Nuclear  Nuclear power is for electricity only and incorporates, like coal power, 35% inefficient steam turbines. Lack of satisfactory nuclear waste disposal strangles the nuclear process, as does its expense and proliferation dangers. To abate climate change and other pollution, fossil fuels should stay underground, where their carbon disposal has already been accomplished. Renewables produce electricity, heat and fuels with proven technology and no additional carbon emissions – for ever. Clearly the priority is to build more renewables plant matched to dramatically improved energy-use efficiency. Let us not be distracted by outmoded dreams.Dr John TwidellHorninghold, Leicestershire  It is hard to see how the UK's future electricity demand and energy security can be met without an element of new nuclear power, to replace some of the existing nuclear stations as they come to the end of their lives. In considering the recently published figures for the Sellafield clean-up (MPs lambast Sellafield management firm, 4 February) it is worth remembering that a large proportion of the costs have arisen as a result of the early military programmes conceived and undertaken under time pressure and under the dark shadow of the nuclear arms race – when future waste management was not accorded the priority it now is. If new civil nuclear electricity generating capacity is commissioned in the UK, waste management and end-of-life decommissioning will be taken properly into account from the start, and so will be less expensive to deal with than the historic legacy of early military programmes.Dr Simon HarrisonInstitution of Engineering and Technology  Revelling in his glumness over turbines in the landscape, Simon Hoggart (2 February) says \"as a means of generating energy they are nearly hopeless\". I'll forgive him his emotions but won't let him off with the technical tosh. Wind turbines work. They generally pay back the energy that was used to build them in less than a year. After that they go on, year after year, displacing gas and coal. At one point in September 10% of the UK's electricity was from wind. Not bad for a technology that scarcely existed in this form 20 years ago! Of course there are space limits on land, which is why so many are involved in the harder challenge of taking these successful machines offshore.Jamie TaylorEdinburgh  If Simon Hoggart is correct in describing belief in the effectiveness of wind turbines as \"essentially religious\", there are a lot of essentially religious people about, including millions of Chinese. China has begun a massive programme of investment in wind energy. The British, as ever, fall behind other countries when it comes to capitalising on technological advances they may have themselves begun.Fay MarshallWorthing, West Sussex\n",

      "Text: Concern that the Great Barrier Reef may be suffering the most severe mass coral bleaching event on record has escalated after a conservation group released footage showing damage up to 18 metres below the surface. Dr Selina Ward, a marine biologist and former academic director of the University of Queensland’s Heron Island Research Station, said it was the worst bleaching she had seen in 30 years working on the reef, and that some coral was starting to die. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority last week said aerial surveys of more than 1,000 individual reefs revealed more than half were rated as having high or very high levels of bleaching, and a smaller number in the south – less than 10% of the total – had extreme bleaching. Only about a quarter were relatively unaffected. It confirmed the 2,300-kilometre reef system was experiencing its fifth mass bleaching event in eight years. The authority said sea surface temperatures had been between 0.5C and 1.5C hotter than expected for this time of year. The Australian Marine Conservation Society on Thursday released video and photos that it said showed bleaching on the southern part of the reef extended to greater depths than had been previously reported this year. Ward said the impact of bleaching had been extensive across 16 sites that she visited in the reef’s southern section, affecting coral species that had usually been resistant to bleaching. Some coral had started to die, a process that usually takes weeks or months after bleaching occurs. “I feel devastated,” she said. “I’ve been working on the reef since 1992 but this [event], I’m really struggling with.” Ward said sea temperatures at two of the sites she visited were the same at the surface and 20 metres below the surface. This was “very unusual”, and reinforced the need for rapid action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, she said. “What are we doing to stop the reef from being lost?” Ward said. “We cannot expect to save the Great Barrier Reef and be opening new fossil fuel developments. It’s time to act and there are no more excuses.” Coral bleaching occurs when the coral becomes heat stressed and ejects the tiny marine algae, known as zooxanthellae, that live in its tissue and give most of its colour and energy. With the zooxanthellae gone, the coral starves and its bone-white calcium skeleton becomes visible. If the elevated temperature doesn’t last long, the coral can recover. Otherwise, it starts to die. In the most severe cases, the bleaching is skipped and the coral dies almost immediately, usually turning a dirty brown. Terry Hughes, an emeritus professor at James Cook University and longtime reef bleaching researcher, said the aerial surveys showed “the most widespread and most severe mass bleaching and mortality event ever recorded on the Great Barrier Reef”. He said the scale of the damage was comparable to 2016, the worst previous year experienced, but there were now fewer individual reefs untouched by bleaching between southern Queensland and the Torres Strait. He said the area south of Townsville had been particularly badly hit this year. “We’re already seeing extensive loss of corals at the time of peak bleaching,” he said. “It’s heartbreaking to see damage as severe as this as soon as this.” Hughes said every part of the reef system had now bleached at least once since 1998. Some reefs had bleached three or four times. He said the cumulative damage made it harder for reefs to recover and more likely they would succumb. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2018 found that most tropical coral reefs would be lost if global heating was limited to an average of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and 99% were likely to be lost of heating reached 2C. They found they would be at high risk at 1.2C, a level that may have already been reached. Dr Lissa Schindler, an ecologist and the reef campaign manager with the Australian Marine Conservation Society, called on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to release maps showing the extent and severity of the bleaching so the public had a true picture of the scale of the impact. Schindler also urged the authority, which she described as the reef’s custodian, to play a greater role in advocating for stronger action on emissions. She said in the past the authority had called for “strong and fast national action” to deal with the climate crisis, but a more recent climate statement it issued focused on global action and did not say anything about Australia needing to increase what it was doing. “If the Albanese government is serious about its commitment to Unesco to protect the reef then it must commit to net zero emissions by 2035 and stop approving new fossil fuel projects,” she said. Scientists have said the government’s emissions reduction targets – a 43% cut compared with 2005 levels and net zero by 2050 – are consistent with global action that could lead to 2C of global heating. Interviewed on ABC’s Radio National on Wednesday, the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the government was “very concerned about the bleaching that we see at the moment, sadly, not just on the Great Barrier Reef, but right around the world”. She said the government was doing “whatever we can” to get to net zero emissions. “We need to protect the reef because it’s … unique in the world and also 64,000 people rely on it for their work,” she said. A reef authority spokesperson said it confirmed in early March that widespread coral bleaching was unfolding. They said in-water coral surveys were continuing and a report including data and maps would be published “in the coming weeks”.\n",

      "Text: The world’s demand for oil, gas and coal will begin to decline this decade in “the beginning of the end” of the fossil fuel era, according to the global energy watchdog. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has projected for the first time that fossil fuel consumption will peak before 2030 and fall into permanent decline as climate policies take effect. However, the forecast downturn is still “nowhere near steep enough” to put the world on a path to limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrialised levels, which is considered crucial to avoiding a climate catastrophe. The IEA’s influential energy outlook report, due to be published next month, will show that oil, gas and coal are on course to hit a peak this decade under existing climate policies, earlier than many have anticipated. Fatih Birol, the IEA’s head, wrote in the Financial Times on Tuesday that the projections would show that “the world is on the cusp of a historic turning point”. “Peaks for the three fossil fuels are a welcome sight, showing that the shift to cleaner and more secure energy systems is speeding up and that efforts to avoid the worst effects of climate change are making headway,” he wrote. Birol said the sooner-than-expected peak for fossil fuels was primarily driven by “the spectacular growth” of clean energy including solar panels and electric vehicles. He also pointed to structural shifts in China’s economy – away from energy-intensive heavy industries – and Europe’s hastened transition away from gas after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, Birol said the projected declines “are nowhere near steep enough to put the world on a path to limiting global warming to 1.5C”. “That will require significantly stronger and faster policy action by governments,” he added. Earlier this year, Birol warned large oil producers “to pay careful attention to the gathering pace of change and calibrate their investment decisions” to the forecast decline in demand for fossil fuels.\n",

      "Predicted Category: Renewable_energy\n",
      "Text: Behind an airtight door, inside a warehouse 10 minutes walk from Bristol city centre, shelves of vibrant chives sprout enthusiastically towards a sky of multicoloured LEDs. The air they are transpiring smells earthy, despite the absence of soil, while a mechanical hum provides a soothing substitute for birdsong. Welcome to the future of farming, where herbs, salads and soft fruits are grown year-round, in vast, indoor plant factories. In June, the British vertical farming startup the Jones Food Company (JFCo), announced it was building the world’s largest vertical farm on the site of an old forge in Lydney, Gloucestershire. Its CEO, James Lloyd-Jones, predicts that within 10 years the UK could be growing all its herbs, salad leaves, soft fruits – and potentially cut flowers – this way: “Vertical farms will become the norm within the supply chain, and probably take away greenhouse production and imports.” The seeds of this revolution are being sown – in vertically stacked layers of sheep’s wool – at JFCo’s innovation centre in Bristol. Lloyd-Jones said: “Vertical farming can grow anything. It just grows lots of things too expensively to be commercially viable, so here is where we are learning how to commercialise it.” In the first of four 69 sq metre grow rooms are stacks of brilliant green chives. Every environmental parameter in the room is tightly controlled, from the temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide content of the room, to the colour spectrum, intensity and pattern of the light-dark cycle, and the nutrients the seedlings are exposed to. By tweaking these parameters, and experimenting with different plant varieties, they are investigating the optimal conditions in which to grow these herbs. “You’re taking away the need for sunlight, and creating every environmental parameter perfectly for the plants’ needs. You’re giving them their best time – effectively, two weeks in Barbados, where they’re coming back relaxed – and then you’re harvesting them,” said Lloyd-Jones. It’s easy to spot which seedlings have hit the jackpot: some of the trays contain lush green carpets of chives; others patchy outcrops. Down the hallway, similar experiments are taking place with coriander and dill, while a 276m2 strawberry laboratory is being constructed across the corridor. Farming this way could have numerous advantages. “One of the big benefits is that we’re growing in a way that doesn’t impact on nature,” said Charlie Guy, cofounder of LettUs Grow, a Bristol-based company that’s developing technology for vertical farms. “It also means we can focus more of our land on things like tree planting. So, from a biodiversity standpoint, there are massive benefits.” Because the nutrient-rich water bathing the plants’ roots is cleaned and re-used up to 30 times, there’s less wastage. There’s also no run-off of pesticides into neighbouring waterways, and no need for herbicides or pesticides, because the plants are shut away indoors. Stacking plants above one another on shelves, and growing them in consistent and optimised conditions, 365 days a year, also means that, in theory, every square metre of land is more productive, compared to conventional farms. Another benefit is consistency in the produce itself. “Vertical farming allows you to grow things with a very consistent appearance and flavour, which means they can be packed more efficiently, and there’s less waste because fewer of the items are unattractive to supermarket buyers,” said Prof Antony Dodd at the John Innes centre, a research hub in Norwich. Even so, as of 2020, only about 30 hectares (75 acres) of operational vertical farmland existed worldwide. A key challenge is that growing crops indoors, 24/7, requires a lot of electricity – to power the lights, heaters, humidifiers and other equipment. JFCo’s solution is investment in renewable energy: The roof of its farm in Lydney – which will eventually provide 1.5 hectares of growing space (equivalent to about 60 tennis courts) – will be entirely covered in solar panels, with space for further panels or a wind turbine on neighbouring land. Guy said: “Energy is always an issue with vertical farms, but when you tie that to renewable energy, then it really is a very sustainable way of growing food, versus importing it from around the world, and the sustainability and supply chain risk issues associated with that.” Companies are also exploring technologies that could reduce the cost of labour, eg by semi-automating the harvesting process: “A bit like a [robotic] Amazon or Ocado pick station, where you do what you need to do with the plant – prune it, pollinate it, take the strawberries off it – and then put it back in its position,” said Lloyd-Jones. To further boost productivity, LettUs Grow is developing aeroponic growth methods, which involves spraying the plant’s roots with a very fine mist of nutrient solution, rather than standing them in it (hydroponics). If the plants have healthy roots, they are going to be able to use energy more efficiently and grow much better. A good analogy is, “if you think about a nice healthy soil, it’s got lots of air pockets in it, it’s got the right amount of nutrients, the right amount of moisture – we can effectively recreate that using aeroponics”, said Guy. Even if these plant pioneers can make vertical farming cost-effective, it is unlikely to replace traditional farming for staple crops, such as wheat, rice or potatoes. These have a longer growing period and require a lot of light, compared with herbs or salad leaves. “A field of wheat also doesn’t sell for as much money as a field of lettuces. There’s a sweet spot in terms of the speed at which things grow, and the amount of energy that needs to go into the system, in order for these facilities to be economically viable,” said Dodd. Where vertical farming could be viable is for crops with shorter growing seasons, such as salad leaves, herbs and soft fruits such as strawberries or blueberries. “It is not the answer to food security, but it’s one of a range of different things that can contribute to producing food in a more sustainable way,” Dodd said.\n",

      "Text: Vladimir Putin's land grab in Crimea has shocked the west into rethinking security strategy on the continent. Michael McFaul, former US ambassador to Moscow, has rightly argued in the New York Times that Putin has made a strategic pivot, and has abandoned reform and partnership with the west for a campaign to consolidate autocratic power at home and erect an alternative to western liberal democracy for the nations in its \"near abroad\". In the efforts to gauge how far Russia will go and what it means for transatlantic institutions, however, a larger theme is being overlooked. That is the role of climate and energy policy in the “long game” that will now play out between Russia and the west. Rather than being a choice between democracy and autocracy, the choice is actually one between patronage-based oil-and-gas oligarchies on the one hand, and adaptive and innovative low-carbon economies on the other. Russia is a country that has fallen victim to the now quite well-understood “resource curse” – the seeming contradiction that countries with great natural wealth, especially in fossil fuels, tend towards autocratic government, systemic corruption and developmental stagnation affecting the general population, combined with extravagant wealth on the part of controlling elites. The leaders of resource-cursed countries rely on networks of patronage among the rent-seeking class that has gained control over natural resources and derivative industries, and such political systems do not change as long as the petro-dollars keep rolling in. At the same time that attention is riveted upon Russian expansionism and efforts to negotiate its limits, the international community is busy working towards a global climate agreement in 2015 that aims to hold warming to 2C in this century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has just issued its first report in seven years on the impact of global warming, showing that the impacts are real and that the world needs to redouble its efforts on climate mitigation and adaptation for at least the generation to come. It is this viewpoint that Putin’s Russia is implicitly rejecting, for the reason that the world’s movement away from the carbon-based energy paradigm would deprive Russia of its immense wealth. Author Bill McKibben has estimated that to achieve this goal up to $20tn worth of fossil fuel reserves would need to remain in the ground, essentially worthless. One can quibble with the numbers, but the conclusion in regards to the current geo-political situation is clear: in the long term the alternative to military containment of an oil-drunk Russian autocracy is authentic, internal reform of the Russian state and economy, which will only occur when the windfall profits that sustain Putinism cease to flow. Now, the world has not devalued these assets yet, but Russia is behaving as if its natural wealth has to be leveraged through its military-industrial complex to convert devaluing assets into territorial gains. Putin’s behaviour is like that of individuals in an inflationary spiral. More and more oil and gas will translate into fewer goods and services. So the strategy is to convert the inflating assets into “real” ones as quickly as possible, before three-quarters of Russia’s natural capital becomes worthless. It will be a diminishing window of opportunity if the world gets serious about climate change. There is enough progressive thinking in Russia today that Putin can be frightened by the threat of a Maidan-type uprising in Moscow. Currently the Russian leader and his cronies have sufficient resources to see off the threat, and the incorporation of new Russian citizens who owe their chance at prosperity to Putin’s decisive leadership provide him with an additional loyal column of support. But the resource curse can come back to haunt him, particularly if oligarchs start fighting among themselves. The west can help move things along by developing an energy security strategy that starves the regime of money. The European Union, while taking a back seat to Nato on security strategy, must lead on a transatlantic alignment on energy and climate security that includes US as well as European shale gas as a bridge leading to a renewables-based economy. Until now the United States has been a laggard in international climate talks, and its domestic energy policies have propped up corrupt and authoritarian regimes around the world. This must change. European countries have been loathe to incur the risks of exploiting their own shale gas resources, but member states should now reconsider their policies, keeping in mind that Europe has the capacity to apply the toughest environmental standards of any energy producing region in the world. Even if Russian territorial ambitions are curbed, Putin has effectively declared a new ideological divide in Europe. If it would be an ideological divide, let it be one between rent-seeking oil and gas oligarchs and sustainability innovators; between closed societies with press controls and open societies with press freedom; between respect for partners and the aspirations of their populations and cynical leveraging of power. In the meantime, let the United States join Europe in seriously engaging the climate negotiations and forging an energy strategy that is both more sustainable and more likely to empower the younger generation of Russians to create opportunities for reform that are currently closed by Putin's fossil fuel fed autocracy.

      "Text: Northern Ireland’s first legally binding climate act faces a race against time to get passed before the devolved institutions at Stormont are dissolved in the coming weeks. The second of two climate change bills – introduced by the agriculture minister, Edwin Poots – has moved through consideration stage, with a batch of new amendments prompting more than 25 hours of assembly debate. But its passage into law is threatened by a congested legislative timetable in the time before Stormont’s dissolution next month to allow for elections. After Paul Givan’s resignation as first minister last week, deputy first minister Michelle O’Neill said the climate bill was among high-priority pieces of legislation that parties would hope to fast-track before the approaching deadline. New features to the bill will see the legislation introduce a 2050 net zero target for Northern Ireland, along with an independent Climate Change Commissioner’s office. Other amendments added to the bill will include a “just transition” fund aimed at supporting agriculture, statutory carbon budgets, targets for biodiversity and soil quality. There will also be a commitment that 10% of future transport budgets will go towards active travel. Northern Ireland is the only jurisdiction in the UK and Ireland at present without dedicated climate legislation. The country’s low public transport spend (27% per head compared with the UK average) and declining biodiversity levels, among other considerations, have emboldened calls for a promised climate act. The Green party NI leader, Clare Bailey, who tabled a first climate bill in 2020, told assembly members this week: “A majority of MLAs have made it clear that they support robust and ambitious climate legislation for Northern Ireland. We will have a net zero Climate Change Act for Northern Ireland, in whatever form it takes, because people want it, and the climate emergency demands it. “It was not so long ago that climate denial was rife in Stormont. I never thought we would see the day where we had such consensus across the political spectrum that action on climate change was urgent and necessary. “The voice of the people has been heard. The will of the assembly has been recorded. I hope that the minister will respect democracy. It’s time for a Climate Change Act for Northern Ireland.” An amendment proposing greater monitoring of Northern Ireland’s nitrogen levels was voted down last week and another proposed amendment seeking an outright ban on fracking was excluded from the consideration stage debate. A separate fracking bill, which follows a 2020 moratorium on petroleum licensing and drilling, is making its way through the assembly. About two weeks are expected for any final amendments to be made to the climate change legislation, before the bill progresses to a final-stage vote and can then become law. Civil society groups and campaigners who had previously criticised the bill’s lack of ambition have welcomed the new additions to the legislation. Daithí McKay, from the Climate Coalition Northern Ireland group, said the bill in its amended form “represents a progressive way forward to net zero”. He added: “The public expects the assembly to deliver and we now need a clear timetable from the minister setting out when he plans to complete the passing of the climate change act.” Friends of the Earth NI director James Orr said: “If the amended bill passes, Northern Ireland will be in a position to hold its head high with the right climate action alongside the rest of the UK and the ROI and will no longer be the only place on these islands without climate legislation. “We must ensure that these amendments are refined and developed to form a collective climate change act that is greater than the sum of its parts – one which truly reflects the gravity of the climate crisis and what needs to be done.” Poots, a strong advocate for Northern Ireland’s agrifood industry, said that implementing a 2050 net zero target would have “profound and irreversible consequences” for the sector. He has also suggested he would seek to “exempt” farmers from some of the bill’s requirements. He said: “I am disappointed that the assembly have agreed an amendment to my climate change bill to set a 2050 net zero target. “To push to net zero within that timeframe will have profound and irreversible consequences for our agri-food sector and our economy. “I will now consider my next steps and aim to find a way forward that minimises the impacts on our agri-food sector and maximises the benefits for the climate change agenda. The approach and actions have to balance climate change, the economy and the wider environment.”\n",

      "Text: The devastating intensification of extreme weather is laid bare today in a Guardian analysis that shows how people across the world are losing their lives and livelihoods due to more deadly and more frequent heatwaves, floods, wildfires and droughts brought by the climate crisis. The analysis of hundreds of scientific studies – the most comprehensive compilation to date – demonstrates beyond any doubt how humanity’s vast carbon emissions are forcing the climate to disastrous new extremes. At least a dozen of the most serious events, from killer heatwaves to broiling seas, would have been all but impossible without human-caused global heating, the analysis found. Most worryingly, all this is happening with a rise of just 1C in the planet’s average temperature. The role of global heating in supercharging extreme weather is happening at “astonishing speed”, scientists say. “The world is changing fast and it’s already hurting us – that is the blunt summary,” said Prof Maarten van Aalst, the director of the International Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre. The world is currently on track for a rise of at least 2.5C. Based on what we have experienced so far, that would deliver death and destruction far greater than already suffered. The studies analysed used a scientific technique called attribution to determine how much worse, or more likely, an extreme weather event was made by human-caused global heating. The technique’s power is in drawing a direct link between the disasters that people suffer through and the often abstract increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases caused by the mass burning of fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution. It brings the scientific reality of the climate crisis crashing home. The climate information website Carbon Brief compiled a new database of attribution studies of more than 500 events – every such study available – and shared it exclusively with the Guardian. The analysis of the database and interviews with the world’s leading attribution scientists shows beyond any doubt that we are already deep into the era of climate death and destruction. The 12 events deemed virtually impossible without humanity’s destabilisation of the climate span the globe, including intense heatwaves in North America, Europe and Japan, soaring temperatures in Siberia and sweltering seas off Australia. Seventy-one per cent of the 500 extreme weather events and trends in the database were found to have been made more likely or more severe by human-caused climate change, including 93% of heatwaves, 68% of droughts and 56% of floods or heavy rain. Only 9% of the events were less likely, mostly cold snaps and snowstorms. One in three deaths caused by summer heat over the last three decades was the direct result of human-caused global heating, implying a toll of millions. Huge financial costs are also now attributable to human influence on the climate, such as $67bn of damages when Hurricane Harvey smashed into Texas and Louisiana in 2017, which was 75% of the total damages from the storm. Global heating has been hurting us for far longer than commonly assumed, with traces of its influence as far back as the heatwaves and droughts that triggered the infamous Dust Bowl in the US in the mid-1930s. Flooding, July 2021 ‘We are in the era of [climate] damage and we have been for decades,” said Dr Fredi Otto, of Imperial College London. “This is what we see strongly in the science, but it’s not reflected in the policies.” This mapping and analysis of climate catastrophes has never been more relevant. Already in 2022, the climate crisis has rampaged around the planet, bringing the reality of global heating into the homes of billions and to the top of news bulletins. Record-breaking heat has hit North America, Europe, China, India and Pakistan, sparking wildfires in many places. Terrible floods have swept Australia, Bangladesh and South Africa. In due course, scientists will firmly link many of these to global heating, as they did for the fiery northern hemisphere summer of 2018. But with a crunch UN climate summit in Egypt in November fast approaching, the urgency of the situation is already clear. The goal of limiting heating to 1.5C was “on life support” with a weakening pulse, said the UN general secretary, António Guterres, in July. Without very rapid action to slash carbon emissions – by 50% by 2030 – far worse extreme weather will ensue. “Gone are the days when global heating was in the future,” said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief who delivered the 2015 Paris climate deal. “Human-induced heating is wrecking lives and livelihoods today. Every day of higher emissions increases human poverty and misery. Continuing on the path of rising emissions is senseless, selfish and avoidable.” Mitzi Jonelle Tan, a youth activist and survivor of the super typhoons that have hit the Philippines, said: “These studies are proof that what is being done is nowhere near enough. This is a life and death situation.” There is no time to waste, says Prof Bill McGuire, at University College London: “What is astonishing is the speed with which global heating is translating into a hike in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather when the average temperature of the planet is up by just a little more than 1C.” Attribution studies have so far assessed only a small fraction of extreme weather events, with particularly concerning gaps in the global south, which is least responsible for the climate crisis but home to many of the people most vulnerable to its effects. But the following is what we know for sure about how much human-caused climate change is to blame for supercharging extreme weather, where it has already hit, and what it has cost us in lives and damage. It is a sobering reckoning of how deeply the climate crisis has already cut into societies and how desperate the need is to stop further deterioration. The fact that global heating drives more extreme weather is no surprise, even if the pace of change is shocking. Greenhouse gases pumped into the atmosphere by human activity trap more of the sun’s heat, putting more energy into weather systems, worsening their impacts. Scorching heatwaves are the most obvious manifestation, and can also set forests ablaze. Hotter air can hold more water vapour – about 7% more per 1C rise – which means more intense downpours and greater floods. The oceans absorb most of the planet’s trapped heat, and warmer seas fuel more powerful hurricanes and typhoons. Those heated waters also expand, pushing up sea level and enabling storms to crash further inland. The question the world’s scientists are tackling is to what extent human-caused global heating is to blame for a particular extreme weather event as opposed to natural variability in weather patterns. Scientists calculate this by using weather records and computer models to compare two worlds. One is the world we are in, heated by our carbon emissions. The other is the world before the mass burning of fossil fuels and rising temperatures. Researchers assess how frequent a specific extreme weather event is in both worlds. If it is more intense or more frequent in our heated world, then the footprint of global heating is clear. Heatwave, May 2022 The most striking single finding of the Guardian analysis of the attribution studies is the identification of at least a dozen major extreme events that would have been wildly improbable without human-caused global heating. “Now, suddenly, we’re seeing the [climate] boundaries have been pushed out so far that we can say, essentially, these events would not have happened without climate change,” said Van Aalst. “Frankly, I’ve been surprised by how often that’s already been the case.” The ferocious “heat dome” that struck the Pacific north-west region of North America in 2021 would have been “virtually impossible without human-caused climate change”, scientists found. Otto said: “It broke records by 5C and really brought home to me that something that was impossible from a statistical point of view can now happen as a new extreme. That is scary.” Yet this once unimaginable calamity would be expected every 10 years on average if the world heats to 2C, Otto said. Her fear is that action to protect people from extreme weather normally uses past disasters as a guide – an approach that is useless if the new extremes are far worse. “It’s really hard if you have never experienced anything even remotely like it.” The searing summer of 2018 saw simultaneous heatwaves stretch across the northern hemisphere from the US to Japan, and bears a striking resemblance to the events unfolding in 2022. “It is virtually certain the 2018 events would not have occurred without human‐induced climate change,” scientists found. Even six years ago, in 2016, the “extreme warmth across Asia would not have been possible without climate change”, another study found. The previously impossible is happening on a planetary scale, too. Earth’s run of record‐breaking hot years from 2014 to 2016 would have had a tiny chance of striking – less than 0.03% – without human-caused heating, researchers found. Another study found that in many areas, the hottest days and seasons “would not have occurred in thousands of years” without global heating. Normally cold places are particularly vulnerable as they are warming the fastest. The phenomenal heat in Siberia in 2020, when the Arctic town of Verkhoyansk registered a record high of 38C in June, “would have been practically impossible” without human influence. That heat led to wildfires, which scientists estimate were 80% more likely due to global heating, and pumped a record 59m tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. The oceans absorb most of the climate crisis’s heat, hitting marine life hard and the billions of people who rely on the seas. The marine heatwave of 2017-18 in the Tasman Sea was “virtually impossible without anthropogenic influence” and resulted in new disease outbreaks in farmed shellfish and the death of wildlife. Almost 90% of marine heatwaves today are attributable to human-induced warming, scientists estimate. Heatwave, July 2018 Counting the toll of the climate crisis begins with deaths, and scientists are just starting to be able to directly link human-caused climate change to human fatalities. The first large-scale study produced stark results: more than a third of heat-related deaths in summer from 1991 to 2018 occurred as a result of human-caused global heating. “Increased mortality is evident on every continent,” said Dr Ana Maria Vicedo-Cabrera, of the University of Berne, Switzerland, who led the study. “​​The key message is that climate change is already affecting our health.” In the worst-affected cities, hundreds of people a year on average are already dying from this extra heat, including in São Paulo (239 deaths), Athens (189), Madrid (177), Tokyo (156), Bangkok (146) and New York (141). The study covered 732 locations in 43 nations; a lack of data limited wider coverage. It is tricky to extrapolate these findings to a global figure, but a rough estimate given by the scientists is more than 100,000 deaths a year. Over decades, that implies a toll of millions of lives. Some places are being hit especially hard. About three-quarters of heat deaths in Ecuador, Colombia, Guatemala and Peru result from human-caused global heating, far above the 37% average in the study. This is a consequence of especially rapid heating in these regions combined with the high vulnerability of poorer people. About 66% of heat deaths in Kuwait and Iran are also attributed to the climate crisis, while in Norway the proportion is almost 50%. Southern Europe has a high number of deaths owing to an elderly population and the rapidly rising frequency of heatwaves. “These estimates of impacts, although a little apocalyptic, are very much needed as they convey a clear message,” said Vicedo-Cabrera. “[These deaths] have occurred with an average global temperature increase of only 1C, which is lower than even the strictest climate targets outlined in the Paris agreement (1.5-2C) and are a fraction of what may occur if emissions are left unchecked.” The grim toll of human-caused global heating on children was revealed in a study that found it had killed 7,000 to 11,000 children under five every year for the last decade in sub-Saharan Africa. The level of heat-related child deaths was double what it would have been without climate change, the researchers said. Prof Dann Mitchell, of the University of Bristol, UK, warned that countries lacking the health data needed for such studies were often among the poorest and most vulnerable, and, worryingly, also major hotspots of rapid population growth, such as India and Nigeria. However, pinning the blame for deaths on global heating does not mean they cannot be prevented with early warnings and adaptation. In Europe, for example, said Van Aalst, “these are almost entirely avoidable deaths”. The number of global heating deaths caused by more complex extreme weather is trickier to assess. But the increased intensity of Hurricane Maria due to human-induced climate change led to the deaths of up to 3,670 people in 2017, according to one study. Extreme weather also destroys houses, businesses, roads, bridges and more, and researchers have begun adding up these costs. Hurricane Harvey’s $67bn in climate costs was in part due to global heating having increased the extreme rainfall by about 20%. In the UK, the exacerbation of four floods between 2000 and 2020 by global heating caused $9bn of damages, half of the total. The food suuplies we rely on are also being ravaged by human-caused global heating. Between 1991 and 2017, $27bn of insured crops in the US were lost as a result of humanity’s emissions. On the other side of the world, New Zealand farmers lost US$185m of crops to the deepening of droughts by the climate crisis in the decade to 2017. Hurricane Harvey, August 2017 Global heating unsurprisingly has a global impact. But the impact of extreme weather is felt locally, by each community, for which global heating has loaded the dice of disaster. July temperatures in France in 2019, when heat records tumbled like dominoes and Paris hit 42.6C, prompted one of the most startling attribution studies to date. It was not just the scientists’ conclusion that “remarkably, the heatwave might not have been possible without climate change”, but the scale of the soaring temperature increases. “The heatwave we looked at in Toulouse would have been 4C cooler without climate change, and that was in a world that had only had 1C of global warming,” Otto said. “A change of 4C is incredible.” Scientists are increasingly concerned that the steady rise in global average temperature is not mirrored by a gradual rise in extreme weather but is delivering extraordinary events. “We so often see things that take us by surprise,” said Van Aalst. “The heat trends in western Europe, for instance, are so much faster in the observations than we would expect from the models.” Researchers think the models do not yet capture all the factors involved. Records were also shattered by the downpours that caused fatal flooding across Germany and Belgium in July 2021, killing at least 243 people. Those rains were found to have been made up to nine times more likely by global heating. The climate crisis is also manifesting in places better known for mild weather. The UK’s temperature record was smashed in 46 different places in July this year, topping 40C for the first time in some, and the heatwave is estimated to have killed about 1,000 people. The heat was made 10 times more likely by global heating. The UK’s wettest day was delivered by Storm Alex in 2020, which cut off power for many. The downpour was made 2.5 times more likely by human climate influence. In the US, Texas suffers frequently. But, more than a decade ago in 2011, when the then governor, Rick Perry, was falsely accusing climate scientists of manipulating data, there was an exceptionally hot summer, found to have been made 10 times more likely by global heating. In California, the worst drought in a millennium hit between 2012 and 2014, with human-caused global heating a “substantial” factor. Tens of thousands of farm workers lost their jobs, billions of dollars of damage was recorded and 100m trees died. Wildfires often accompany droughts, and they have raged across the western US, torching homes and more. The area burned between 1984 and 2015 was doubled by global heating, scientists estimate. In Canada’s wildfire season of 2017, the record area burned in British Columbia – more than a million hectares – was between seven and 11 times greater than it would have been without global heating. Heatwave, July 2021 The continent that is home to nearly two-thirds of the human race is being hit by the climate storm just as hard as elsewhere. Most unequivocal was the finding that the extreme warmth across the region in 2016, which affected billions, “would not have been possible without climate change”. Global heating supercharged the super typhoon Haiyan, which battered the Philippines in 2013, pushing up a storm surge that sent ocean water crashing inland by 20%, killing 7,000 people. “I grew up seeing these typhoons devastating our communities,” said Tan, the youth activist. “These attribution studies aren’t just studies. Each statistic reflects a community that experienced that extreme weather event – a family, an individual, a student, a young person whose lives were devastated because of the climate crisis.” China in particular is enduring a rollercoaster of extreme weather made worse by global heating. Exceptional rains at the start of 2019 were made 30% more likely and blocked out the sun in the Middle-Lower Yangtze Plain, cutting sunshine hours by 57% and reducing rice production. By May that year, drought conditions had arrived in south-west China. The severe low rainfall event was made about six times more likely by human climate influence. Extreme wildfires followed in south China, with the weather-related risk ramped up sevenfold by global heating. In one conflagration, “a huge fireball was formed in an instant”, the authorities reported, killing 30 people. A year later, it was heavy rain that struck south-west China in August. Flood waters reached the toes of the famous Leshan Giant Buddha statue for the first time since the communist state was formed in 1949. The deluge was made twice as likely by human influence. In 2020, heat plagued southern China – “hot events similar to [this] cannot occur under past climate,” researchers said. India, Asia’s other population superpower, has been far less studied. But a rapid analysis found that the sweltering heat that hit north-west India and south-east Pakistan in March and April this year was made 30 times more likely by the climate crisis. A similar heatwave in 2010 was made 100 times more likely, scientists calculated. Deadly fires in Indonesia in 2015 were boosted by high temperatures, the chances of which were “substantially increased” by human-induced climate change. The vast haze of smoke that engulfed the region, and kept millions of children out of school, is estimated to have killed 100,000 people. The Arabian Gulf, which may face unsurvivable conditions in future, appears to have been barely assessed by attribution studies. Australia may until recently have had a government that had little concern for the climate crisis, but the climate crisis remains an extraordinary concern for Australia. In the notorious “black summer” of 2019-20 there were blazing bushfires, and the influence of global heating is now clear. The summer saw a high fire weather index, a measure of dangerous conditions, that was made four times more likely by global heating. Two years earlier, a baking summer in New South Wales was made “at least 50 times more likely”, while a record warm Australian spring in 2014 would probably never have occurred without human-driven CO2 rises in previous decades. While people sweltered, so did the famous Great Barrier Reef, which suffered a “catastrophic die-off” of corals in 2016. The hot March weather that caused it was made at least 175 times more likely by the human influence on the climate. Marine heatwave, March 2016 The “biggest tragedy we have ever seen”, was how the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, described floods in April 2022 that killed many hundreds of people and led to the declaration of a national state of disaster. Global heating made them twice as likely and more intense. Drought has also been exacerbated, with the high-profile “day zero” event in Cape Town in 2018 the result of an exceptionally dry three years – a pattern made “five to six times more likely” by global heating. The rest of Africa has been poorly studied. But global heating played a significant role in the 2015 drought in Ethiopia, the worst in decades, affecting nearly 10 million people and killing crops and livestock. In Lesotho, global heating was a “critical driver” of a food crisis that gripped the nation in 2007. Van Aalst said it is vital to remember that these climate-driven events do not act alone but compound other problems. “For instance, there is terrible hunger in the Horn of Africa, with literally thousands of people dying right now and the potential for hundreds of thousands more,” he said. “That is partly drought and other climate-related hazards – they’ve had floods and locust infestations as well.” But the extreme weather had intensified the problems caused by conflicts, a Covid-related rise in extreme poverty and high food prices due to the war in Ukraine, he said. Not all extreme weather events analysed find an influence from global heating. But these studies are revealing too, said Otto, in highlighting the depth of existing fragility. The recent famine in Madagascar was the result of poverty and overreliance on annual rains, not global heating, research found. “This showed just how much there is to do to even be resilient in the face of the current climate that we have,” let alone a worsening one, Otto said. Drought, 2015 On 27 May this year in north-east Brazil, 22 days’ worth of rain fell in 24 hours. It was part of a week of downpours that led to catastrophic floods and landslides, killing at least 133 people and displacing tens of thousands more. A rapid assessment found global heating was at least partly responsible. But few other attribution studies have been done in Latin America, home to 650 million people. One found the fingerprints of global heating on a severe drought in the southern Amazon in 2010. The subsequent die-off of trees, and stunted growth of others, resulted in 4bn more tonnes of CO2 in the atmosphere, roughly equivalent to the annual emissions of the European Union. Even more temperate parts of South America have been affected. In December 2013, Argentina endured a heatwave made five times more likely by global heating, and in 2017 major floods in Uruguay were made more likely by the same factor. The scarcity of studies in the global south worries scientists. “It’s a huge concern and is adding to the injustice of climate change,” said Van Aalst. “The people that have contributed the least to it are hit the hardest and we can’t even tell how bad it really is.” The lack of knowledge is preventing people from finding the best ways to deal with the impacts, says Otto. “Attribution studies are not just about distilling the role of climate change but about trying to disentangle drivers of disasters.” The problem is the lack of local scientific expertise and funding – most researchers work on attribution studies as volunteers. “Without crucial support for global south-based research, we will be forgotten once again,” said Tan. The heaviest footprint of the climate crisis on human suffering has been found in recent events, but global heating has been hurting us for many years. There are traces of its influence on the heatwaves that caused the Dust Bowl in the US in the mid-1930s. The starving families forced to leave their homes, immortalised in John Steinbeck’s novel The Grapes of Wrath, are mirrored by those enduring heat, drought and hunger today. A global study of hot weather events since 1900 also found “a significant human contribution to the probability of record‐breaking global temperature events as early as the 1930s”. More than 20 years ago, before many of today’s youth climate strikers were born, Australia’s “millennium drought” was “partially attributable to anthropogenic greenhouse warming”. In England, two-thirds of the autumn floods in 2000 were made 90% more likely by global heating. And researchers now estimate that flood heights from Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans in 2005, would have been 15-60% lower without global heating. The science of attribution has delivered a bleak but undeniable picture of how global heating is already bringing death and destruction. But what about the future? “This is what a feverish Earth looks like today,” said Bill McKibben, a climate author and campaigner. “The fact that we’re currently headed for 3C of temperature rise, in the light of these studies, is of course terrifying. And 3C won’t be three times as worse – the damage will be exponential, not linear.” Vicedo-Cabrera was blunt about our prospects. As the world heated up more and urban populations grew, she said, “the number of [heat] deaths will be much larger”. The lack of attention paid to scientists’ prior warnings frustrates Van Aalst, who is worried by the pace of the escalating damage. “We are seeing worst-case scenarios known about 10 years ago, that we had feared might happen several decades on, already playing out right now,” he said. Is there any reason for hope? Perhaps the world will finally realise that acting now is far cheaper than not. “The impacts are so much more expensive than anything we would do to mitigate them,” said Otto. Attribution studies might also help accelerate the vital funds needed by poorer nations to rebuild after disasters. “They prove that specific extreme weather events, whose damage we know the costs of, were caused by the climate crisis,” said Tan. Figueres remains stubbornly optimistic. “We are not doomed to a continuation of this madness. We – each of us – still hold the pen that will write the future. Collectively, we have the capacity to make the extraordinary changes we need in order to course correct.” “It is precisely at this late hour, when for many the darkness is at its most intense, we must find the strength to stand up in the firm conviction that this challenge is as daunting as it is conquerable, and that we can sprint toward the light,” she added. In the grip of the Dust Bowl, Steinbeck’s character Ma also understood that the future was yet to be written. “Up ahead they’s a thousan’ lives we might live,” she said, “but when it comes it’ll on’y be one.” Tell us what you think about the Guardian’s climate reporting – it takes just 2 minutes\n",

      "Text: Surging sales of electric vehicles show the automotive revolution is coming, but its arrival is being held up by a fundamental problem: a lack of charging stations. This was apparent over the Australian summer when long queues formed at public chargers on holiday travel routes. There are about 3,700 public chargers, at just over 2,100 locations, across Australia, according to an Electric Vehicle Council report published in October – a fraction of the number in many comparable countries. In Canada, drivers have access to more than 16,000 public chargers at about 7,000 locations. But despite government and business pledges to fix the problem, those best placed to do so – charger manufacturers – are stuck in their own queues waiting for microchips, the same in-demand component causing production delays of new vehicles. The Electric Vehicle Council chief executive, Behyad Jafari, says the holdup has its roots in a “lost decade” when EVs were treated as a political football and there was no overarching policy to spur investment in supporting infrastructure. “We had 10 years of the previous federal government just refusing to act on this issue,” he says, noting that conservative governments in Europe designed EV-supportive policies during that same period. “The result is that we could have had more investment. Now we need to catch up.” Despite taking similar electric vehicle policies to the 2019 election, the then prime minister Scott Morrison said an EV could not “tow your trailer” or a boat and could not “get you out to your favourite camping spot”. The negative messaging had a direct impact on the business sector, says Jafari, which looks for policy stability before making investment decisions, such as building charging infrastructure. More than one in 20 new cars bought in January were electric, industry figures show, marking another month of strong gains, although the purchases still lag well behind China, Europe and North America, where EVs attract a much larger share of new sales. In the US, about 13% of new cars are electric, while the figure is as high as 80% in Norway. While the case for charging stations in Australia is clear, those involved in their manufacture face delays, with clogged shipping routes and shortages of microchips – or semiconductors – holding up production. Australia’s dominant fast-charger maker and supplier, the Brisbane-based and US-listed Tritium, says the lead time on some semiconductors is 52 weeks. The manufacturer has also contended with long pandemic-related delays for shipping. “We probably could have built more if we hadn’t had some of those supply chain issues, but we were also scaling the company,” says the Tritium chief executive, Jane Hunter. Part of the company’s solution is to expand its manufacturing bases, which includes a new plant in the US state of Tennessee that can take some pressure off its Australian facilities and increase overall production. Hunter says countries require a comprehensive EV policy to give businesses the confidence to build supportive infrastructure, which she says has been lacking in Australia. “When we see government policy launch in favour of EVs, we see a flurry of orders in that region,” she says, noting an increase in charger demand after the UK announced there would be a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans at the end of the decade. “You can’t overestimate how much government announcements can drive demand. It’s something I’ve tried to talk to the Australian government about – the fact that, to an extent, you don’t even need to put significant money and funding behind it,” says Hunter, adding that Australia’s large size means there’s a role for the government to fund charging stations in remote areas. While policies, such as the national electric vehicle strategy, are now rolling out following last year’s change in federal government, orders for chargers have been flooding in from around the world for years, creating a backlog and putting Australia behind in the global race. While Tritium was born in Brisbane, it’s a global supplier that manufactures more chargers for European and US buyers than for Australia. There is no quick fix for the chip shortage that is linked to a decision in early 2020 by carmakers to cut orders amid temporary plant closures and fears sales would reduce dramatically in a global pandemic. Instead, demand for vehicles and numerous other products that use semiconductors soon surged and the costly production process of making a tiny component that manages the flow of electric current could not keep pace. Carmakers and battery recharger manufacturers now compete for the same components and there is even a shadow market where dealers buy up semiconductors and on-sell at higher prices. Wait lists for popular cars can extend well over 12 months, including for a variety of EV and hybrid vehicles, and there is no immediate respite, says the Australian Automotive Dealer Association chief executive, James Voortman. “There’s a big backlog of orders we have to clear and that affects the ability to bring in new stock,” says Voortman. “The expectation is that we are probably looking at another year of this, hopefully improving in 2024. Today we are talking about a microchip shortage; tomorrow we might well be talking about shortages of minerals such as lithium, cobalt and all of those critical minerals that go into an EV battery.” Electrifying Australia’s highways also requires adequate grid capacity and land access for recharge stations, which would rely on government agencies, utilities and businesses working together. There is also an emerging problem of some older chargers experiencing faults and there are delays in getting the components required to fix them. The NRMA energy and infrastructure chief executive, Carly Irving-Dolan, says the problems are hitting at the same time as demands on infrastructure increase. “We are a little bit at the whim of our suppliers and that’s probably why we are looking at different vendors,” says Irving-Dolan. “We are putting all the balls in the air and really trying to stop what’s happened over Christmas happening again, but there’s going to be some places which take longer to get connected.”\n",

      "Text: It’s 4.30am and the sky is already light above Knepp, the Sussex estate whose 3,500 acres have been transformed from intensively farmed agricultural land to one of the richest natural environments in the country. I’m with Penny Green, the estate’s resident ecologist, and here to see turtle doves, birds whose mellifluous purring once played a starring role in the soundscape of British summers, but whose numbers have fallen by 93% since 1994. Streptopelia turtur’s devastating decline is largely down to exactly the sort of commercial farming that Knepp’s owners, Charlie Burrell and Isabella Tree, have set themselves against. It’s fitting, then, that one of the largest populations of nesting doves in the country – 16 pairs – is found right here. We walk out towards the setting strawberry moon, hanging huge and milky over meadows in which thickets of oak, sallow and hawthorn rise. We walk long diagonals through fleabane and ragwort, the clay beneath our feet baked hard. In the corner of one field, we hear a strange croaking, then spy its source: a nightingale fledgling newly emerged from its nest. It’s only as we head back that we see him, the turtle dove breasting the air, tawny in the sun, and then a flash of the scalloped intricacy of his back. He takes up residence in a nearby tree and begins to call. I didn’t hear turtle doves in my own childhood, but the sound is so powerfully evocative that it summons visions of old hot summers, of a time before pesticides and decades of poor stewardship drove these birds from our land. One of Knepp’s white storks rises in the background, and butterflies and dragonflies dart around us, but I’m wholly focused on that stream of notes, which you seem to feel as much as hear. In Tree’s beautiful book about Knepp, Wilding, she describes how hearing the turtle dove gives you the impression of being “caught in the crosshairs of time”. And that is how it is, standing in this new-formed wilderness, listening to a bird that we are so close to losing but that still feels a vital part of our world.\n",

      "Text: The Dutch government is offering to buy out up to 3,000 “peak polluter” farms and major industrial polluters in an attempt to reduce ammonia and nitrogen oxide emissions that are illegal under EU law. The nitrogen minister, Christianne van der Wal, said farmers would be offered more than 100% of the value of their farms to quit. For the first time, the government has said that forced buyouts will follow next year if the voluntary measures fail. The group of 2,000 to 3,000 “peak polluters” – who are “mostly farmers”, an agriculture ministry spokesperson told the Guardian – will be offered a final set of choices: innovate to drastically reduce emissions, transition to a new kind of business, extend in ways that reduce their impact, relocate or “voluntarily stop”. “For agricultural entrepreneurs, there will be a stopping scheme that will be as attractive as possible,” said Van der Wal in a series of parliamentary briefings. “For industrial peak polluters, we will get to work with a tailor-made approach and in tightening permits. After a year, we will see if this has achieved enough.” Top industrial polluters include the businesses Tata Steel, Schiphol airport, refineries owned by Shell, BP and Esso, Dow chemicals and industrial companies such as Olam Cacoa and Cargill Cacoa, according to a report in the Telegraaf. This is the first time the Dutch government has committed to a controversial mandatory buyout, or expropriation scheme, after it was first mentioned in a government research report outlining a 30% livestock reduction by 2030. The latest announcement follows months of furious farmer protests, strong support for a new pro-farmers party, tense negotiations and a 58-page report called “What we can do” by the parliamentarian Johan Remkes. It is seen as the last chance for an agricultural sector that emits an estimated 45% of greenhouse gases including ammonia and nitrogen-based runoffs from fertiliser. The government’s hand has been forced by a court case in 2019 that said the PAS-melding, a kind of nitrogen futures trading scheme for farmers and industrial firms, was illegal because it could not be shown that the development would not damage EU-protected natural reserves known as Natura 2000 areas. The court ruling led to a temporary building stop and 100km/h limit on roads, and made about 2,500 farms illegal at a stroke. A second Raad van State ruling this month said Dutch building projects needed nitrogen permission, putting government plans to build 900,000 desperately needed homes, windfarms and vital infrastructure at a standstill. “[The reduction] is going to happen,” said Tjeerd de Groot, the D66 party agriculture spokesperson, who believes the country must reduce numbers of pigs and chickens by 50% and graze cows on grass. “I’m very hopeful now, because it’s not only voluntary any more. The whole economy has come to a stop because of this nitrogen question. “This makes the political pressure, also in conservative, farmer-oriented societies, big. A relatively small part of the economy is blocking the rest of society, quite apart from the problems with biodiversity and degradation. Now it’s going to happen because we have our backs against the wall.” Despite previous voluntary buyout schemes, only about 30 farmers stopped, according to the Volkskrant. New figures show that animal numbers have remained more or less the same in the last decade, with more than five times as many farmed animals in the Netherlands as its 17.8 million people. Farmers are furious. The BoerBurgerBeweging (farmer-citizen movement) said it was “astonished that farmers and their families have to continue living in uncertainty” for another year. Environmentalists are cautiously optimistic. Natasja Oerlemans, the head of the food team at WWF Netherlands, said while farmers were not to blame for following the system, reform had been needed for years. “In all, we think that this could lead to a promising pathway for the much needed agri-transition in the Netherlands,” she said, but added it was still uncertain how the government would enforce the shutdowns if its voluntary approach failed.\n",

      "Text: Coal power plants in New South Wales are running less than 60% of the time due to an influx of renewable energy, increasing the likelihood some could become economically unviable and close earlier than planned. An analysis by Hugh Saddler, an energy consultant and ANU honorary associate professor, also found coal generation in Queensland had dropped to less than 70% of capacity as more cheap solar and wind came online. Saddler said the resulting fall in revenue for coal plant owners, and the wear and tear involved in ramping up and down decades-old generators designed to be run constantly, increased the likelihood of breakdowns and early closures in the years ahead. AGL’s Liddell coal plant is scheduled to close by early 2023 after the company resisted a campaign by the Morrison government for it to extend its life. Saddler said the fall in demand for coal over the past two years suggested other plants that have yet to confirm closure plans could follow. He said coal could be running at 50% capacity in NSW by 2022 and 60% capacity in Queensland by 2025 on current trends. “Ageing coal power stations like Liddell will find it increasingly difficult to stay afloat if they are only being used half the time, and that is the direction we appear to be heading in NSW in the next two years,” Saddler said. “If there are extended breakdowns, as we had at Loy Yang A in Victoria last year, it may not be economic for owners to keep a plant going.” Saddler said it underlined the need for better national planning for the future of the electricity grid, including timing investments in new renewable generation and storage to prevent a surge in power prices like that experienced when Victoria’s Hazelwood plant shut in 2017. The Australian Energy Market Operator this year found solar and wind were the cheapest forms of new electricity generation, and that the national grid had the technical capacity to run on at least 75% renewable energy and could at peak times reach this level by 2025. Saddler said the Energy Security Board, which reports to federal and state energy ministers, was considering future planning but there had been a gap in national leadership since the Coalition dropped plans for an overarching energy policy when Scott Morrison replaced Malcolm Turnbull in 2018. The analysis is included in Saddler’s monthly audit of national energy emissions published by the Australia Institute, a progressive thinktank. The institute’s climate and energy director, Richie Merzian, said it showed AGL was making the correct call to shut Liddell and replace it with cleaner energy. He noted the government appeared to have accepted Liddell would shut – the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, acknowledged it in a tweet last week – and should explain why it was yet to release a report by a taskforce set up to advise on how its closure would affect NSW’s power supply. The Australia Institute analysis follows the release on Monday of the latest national greenhouse gas emissions data. It found total emissions were down 1.4% in the year to March due to the rise of renewable energy and the devastating impact of the drought on agriculture. Emissions from industry, particularly gas production, continued to rise. Taylor’s office also released an early estimate of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic shutdown on emissions on the June quarter, suggesting they could be 8% lower than a year earlier, with pollution from transport likely to be well down. A recent analysis suggested that Australia’s greenhouse gas accounting underestimates national emissions by about 10%, largely due to a failure to properly recognise the impact of methane released during gas production. The Morrison government has been championing a gas-led recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Leading scientists last week released a letter to the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, warning his advocacy for increased use of gas-fired electricity was at odds with the Paris agreement and not consistent with a plan to secure a safe climate. Independent MP Zali Steggall on Monday said she planned to table a previously announced private member’s climate change bill in Parliament on 9 November to coincide with what would have been the start of the UN climate conference in Glasgow had it not been delayed due to the virus. The bill, which has the support of other independents, some leading scientists and the Business Council of Australia, would set a national goal of net zero emissions by 2050, a target rejected by the Morrison government. Steggall said it would create an “opportunity to rebuild from the Covid-19 crisis in a sustainable way, future proofing our jobs and economy”. Saddler’s audit found the emissions intensity of the national electricity market, including the five eastern states and the Australian Capital Territory, had fallen 25% below its historic maximum in 2008. The move from coal to renewable energy has been more rapid in the southern states than in NSW and Queensland. The proportion of wind and solar in Victoria and South Australia has almost doubled in the past four years to reach 29%, while coal’s share fell from 72% to 53%. By comparison, NSW and Queensland get just 14.5% of their energy from wind and solar. But that was expected to grow as the states promised new renewable energy zones that would put further pressure on coal. Across the five eastern states, so far this year black coal has provided 50% of electricity generation, renewable sources (wind, solar and hydro) nearly 25%, brown coal 17% and gas 8%.\n",

      "Text: Australia has the highest greenhouse gas emissions from coal power in the world on a per capita basis, nearly doubling those in China, according to a new analysis released at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. As the talks headed towards a fraught final day, there was disagreement over whether a closing declaration would commit countries to return with stronger short-term emissions reduction targets next year, and explicitly support an accelerated phaseout of coal. The British climate and energy thinktank Ember released an analysis that suggested the world’s wealthiest countries remained among the worst emitters from coal power once population was factored in. Australia topped the list, with annual per person emissions five times greater than the global average and 40% higher than any other major coal power user. Examining the period since the landmark Paris agreement was signed in 2015, the analysis found Australia emitted 5.34 tonnes of carbon dioxide per person each year, placing it ahead of South Korea (3.81), South Africa (3.19), the US (3.08) and the world’s biggest outright emitter, China (2.71). Ember cited the International Energy Agency to argue OECD countries including Australia should end coal power by 2030 if they were to play their part in attempting to keep global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – a goal of the Paris agreement – within reach. The Morrison government has rejected this and did not join a group of countries that pledged to phase out burning coal for electricity. Dave Jones, Ember’s global program lead, said Cop26 had seen a divergence between developing Asian countries and major OECD coal users over the need to close coal generation. Vietnam had pledged to stop building coal plants and to stop using it in the 2040s, and Indonesia, the Philippines and India had shown signs they were changing previously held positions. He said by comparison arguments put forward by Australia, Japan and South Korea were “embarrassing” and “simply untenable”. “They will undoubtedly be forced to change their position in the coming months,” Jones said. Ban Ki-moon, a former UN secretary general and deputy chair of The Elders, an international non-governmental organisation of senior statespeople, said the potential of renewable energy was growing exponentially and OECD countries needed to align with the target of phasing out coal entirely by the end of the decade. “This will be a true demonstration of global leadership,” he said. About 60% of Australia’s electricity over the past year came from burning coal. That proportion is gradually diminishing and the country’s coal fleet is ageing, but under current closure schedules it would continue to use coal power until the late 2040s. The Morrison government has been heavily criticised in Glasgow for its ongoing support of fossil fuels. Greenpeace International head Jennifer Morgan grouped it with Saudi Arabia as a “wrecker” opposed to the action needed to cut emissions and provide the finance needed to help developing countries respond. Australia was one of only four countries, along with Indonesia, Mexico and Singapore, that chose to just resubmit the same 2030 emissions target at Cop26. Australia’s has committed to only a 26-28% cut compared with 2005 levels, though government projections suggest it could make a cut of up to 35%, in part due to state government policies. Scientists have advised global emissions need to be cut by 45% by the end of the decade. Mary Robinson, a former president of Ireland and chair of The Elders, said leaders of developing countries were “in crisis mode” at the talks but some leaders who could do the most to address the problem were not. She bracketed Australia with Saudi Arabia, Brazil, China and Russia. “Australia, a wealthy country, is still in fossil fuel mode, not in crisis mode,” she told the UK’s Sky News. The talks were boosted late on Wednesday by a surprise joint declaration by the two biggest emitters, China and the US, that they would work together to cut emissions in the crucial next decade. But there was significant disagreement between countries over a draft text released Wednesday morning. It included a proposal that countries return to the negotiating table next year with new plans to ramp up emission cuts this decade. Under the Paris agreement, countries are expected to return with better pledges in 2025 but - with a chasm between existing commitments and the deep cuts needed - many are now demanding the deadline should be brought forward. The draft text also proposed countries agree to accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels. Australia has not been represented at a political level at the talks since Angus Taylor, the emissions reduction minister, left a week ago, and it has not made public its position on key parts of draft text released on Wednesday morning. But Scott Morrison has previously strongly opposed suggestions coal power should be actively phased out, and said he has no plans to increase Australia’s 2030 commitment. In a statement on Thursday, Taylor said Australia was “an active and constructive participant in the negotiations to ensure a positive outcome”. There is dispute between countries over whether the text will keep a reference to the scientific case for limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, with some large developing countries reportedly opposed. Poor countries said much more needed to be done to increase finance packages to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown. Scientists at the talks expressed frustration that rhetoric from global leaders was not being matched by action, and warned that every extra fraction of a degree of global heating would have dire consequences.\n",

      "Text: My friend Martin Alder, who has died aged 69 from an embolism, was a driving force in building the renewable energy industry in Britain. Martin led the renewable energy committee of the Association of Electricity Producers from 1992 until 2014, by which time it had become Energy UK. He also served as the association’s vice-chair, supporting renewable energy interests on the board alongside representatives from the largest British electricity companies. He steered this broad church of member companies towards policies that have increased the proportion of UK electricity provided from renewable energy from 2% in 1992 to more than 25% today. Internationally, he was the chair of the World Renewable Energy Network. Martin was born in Stonehouse, Gloucestershire. His mother, Annie (nee Jones), worked in service. His father, Arthur, was a clerk in the civil service. Martin went to Maidenhill secondary modern school in Stonehouse; then studied mechanical engineering at Liverpool University, graduating with a first. He met Cathryn Ogden through the Scouts and Guides when they were both teenagers, and they married in 1969. Martin worked at British Rail and Gloucester hospital before joining Wessex Water, managing a sewage treatment works at Avonmouth. There he was instrumental in a project that stopped sewage being dumped into the Severn estuary by turning it into fertiliser granules. He moved to UK Waste, working on reducing landfill and building waste-to-energy plant, and to the engineering and planning company WS Atkins. Then, as the electricity sector had started to open up to independent generation and supply, in 1995 he was a founder of the Renewable Energy Company and later, through Wind Direct and Optimum Energy, worked with factory owners and others across Britain to realise renewable energy projects, building rapport with people along the way. He was creative, smart and practical – and funny. He engaged enthusiastically with everyone as equals. He was a member of the Co-operative Society and considered himself a socialist, having been a member of the Labour party and CND in the 1970s and 80s. He served as a magistrate in Stroud in the 80s and 90s and was a die-hard supporter of Liverpool football club. Martin is survived by Cathryn, their sons, Ben and Dan, and his three grandchildren, Erin, Monty and Oscar.\n",

      "Text: Construction of Australia’s largest ever mine will be well underway before its impact upon the environment is known, with a requirement to replace critically endangered habitat razed by the project pushed back by two full years after a backdown by the federal government. Documents seen by Guardian Australia show that the government scaled back its initial environmental conditions for the Carmichael mine in central Queensland following a request by Adani, the proponent. The changes effectively mean the $16.5bn mine’s impact on crucial groundwater supplies, beyond the 297bn litres it will extract from aquifers, will be largely unknown until the project is at an advanced stage. More than 35,000ha of habitat, containing the endangered black-throated finch and the vulnerable yakka skink, will be flattened for the mine. Indian firm Adani was initially required to secure land elsewhere to compensate for this loss prior to construction, but will now not have to do this until two years after the project starts. The Carmichael mine is being enthusiastically backed by the Queensland government, which has offered to fund part of the project. The mine, which was approved in July, will extract 60m tonnes of coal a year for export to India. Emissions from the burned coal will create an estimated 128m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, around four times the annual greenhouse gas output of New Zealand. In draft conditions drawn up by the federal Department of the Environment, Adani was told to submit a groundwater management and monitoring plan at least three months before commencement of the project. The final approval in July, however, changed this to three months “prior to commencing excavation of the first box cut” – which is the point where the ground is opened up to begin mining coal. This means the full impact upon groundwater will remain a mystery until Adani is poised to commence mining. The Independent Expert Scientific Committee advised the government in May that Adani’s initial attempt at measuring the impact upon water required further work. The final Department of the Environment assessment, which has to judge whether proponents are of suitable character, also states: “Adani Group has a history of responsible environmental and community management applied to similar projects in other countries.” This is despite an arm of the company being fined for numerous environmental breaches in India, as well as being accused of violations of workers’ rights. Adani submitted suggested amendments to 14 of the draft conditions, largely to bring them in line with an approval already granted by the Queensland government. The company sent the proposed changes on 3 July, with the amended final decision made on 14 July. Adam Walters, spokesman for Greenpeace, said the final approval pays “lip service” to environmental protection. “It makes it completely legal for no one to understand the impacts of the project before it starts and for it to be shoved into a backroom process with no public scrutiny,” he told Guardian Australia. “The monitoring of water has been found to be inadequate by an independent body but rather than force Adani to assess it properly, the government has given it the green light. “Groundwater is the lifeblood of that region. There are special springs near the mine, real oases of life in a very arid area. We won’t know what the impact on them will be. “We also have an approval based on the word of Adani that they know where to get offset habitat, so they are able to destroy valuable habitat without securing a replacement. There are species that will suffer a very uncertain future because of this. “This shows the system is broken, that the government is weak on these issues and didn’t stand up to the miner on this.” Government documents highlighting the potential “pros and cons” of the project show that it will contribute $2.97bn each year to the Queensland economy at full export capacity, creating 3,920 jobs once it is operational. However, it states the mine will also cause living costs to rise, “labour market drain from other sectors into the mining industry”, increased pressure on community services and “reduced amenity for landholders.” The Carmichael mine will transport coal to an expanded port at Abbot Point by a 388km rail line. On Monday, the Queensland government announced it will take a “short-term financial stake” in the rail line as part of a strategy to fund Galilee basin coal projects to ensure they eventuate. A raft of international banks, including Citi, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays, have explicitly ruled out funding Adani’s project. The mine development has raised environmental concerns, due to its impact on climate change and the Great Barrier Reef, as well as financial uncertainty due to the depressed price of coal. A spokesman for the Department of the Environment said the change to the groundwater requirements was taken “to better align the timing for the plan with the expected project stage when impacts to groundwater will potentially start to occur”. “The magnitude of the likely impacts on groundwater were taken into account when the project was approved. The project will be staged over a number of years, and any impacts on groundwater are expected to occur after work commences on the bulk earthworks (box cut) required for underground or open-cut mining.” The spokesman added that Adani will be expected to “actively manage” the mining site for endangered species while replacement habitat is found. A spokesman for Adani said: “The approval of the Carmichael mine was the subject of some of the most strict and stringent conditions ever imposed on a project in this country. “We welcomed the approval then, and will adhere to its conditions. The approvals process in place is as stringent, if not more so, than those that apply in comparable jurisdictions.”\n",

      "Text: Australia is in the midst of a full-blown land-clearing crisis. Projections suggest that in the two decades to 2030, 3m hectares of untouched forest will have been bulldozed in eastern Australia. The crisis is driven primarily by a booming livestock industry but is ushered in by governments that fail to introduce restrictions and refuse to apply existing restrictions. And more than just trees are at stake. Australia has a rich biodiversity, with nearly 8% of all Earth’s plant and animal species finding a home on the continent. About 85% of the country’s plants, 84% of its mammals and 45% of its birds are found nowhere else. But land clearing is putting that at risk. About three-quarters of Australia’s 1,640 plants and animals listed by the government as threatened have habitat loss listed as one of their main threats. Much of the land clearing in Queensland – which accounts for the majority in Australia – drives pollution into rivers that drain on to the Great Barrier Reef, adding to the pressures on it. And of course land clearing is exacerbating climate change. In 1990, before short-lived land-clearing controls came into place, a quarter of Australia’s total greenhouse gas emissions were caused by deforestation. Emissions from land clearing dropped after 2010 but are rising sharply again. “It has gotten so bad that WWF International put it on the list of global deforestation fronts, the only one in the developed world on that list,” says Martin Taylor, the protected areas and conservation science manager at WWF Australia. In Queensland, where there is both the most clearing and the best data on clearing, trees are being bulldozed at a phenomenal rate. About 395,000 hectares of native vegetation were cleared there in 2015-16, 33% more compared with the previous year. And despite the re-elected Labor government promising changes to rein it in, notifications of planned land clearing in Queensland have jumped a further 30%, suggesting woodlands could be bulldozed even faster in coming years. To visualise what clearing of that magnitude looks like, Guardian Australia has created a tool that will lay an area that size over any location you choose. Mapped over Sydney, for example, 395,000 hectares covers an area stretching from the central coast in the north, to Campbeltown in the south, and the Blue Mountains in the west. That equates to more than 1,500 football fields worth of native woodland and scrub being cleared each and every day in Queensland. Stopping the clearing in Queensland is possible. Indeed, under its Labor premier Peter Beattie it brought its land clearing problem under control. Tough laws passed in 2004 meant that by 2010 land clearing had dropped to an all-time low of about 92,000 hectares. But when the Liberal National party’s Campbell Newman was elected in 2012 he broke an election promise to keep the laws, gutted them, and introduced several ways for farmers to clear land easily. The bulldozers roared back into action immediately, bringing the state to the point it is at now. Queensland clears more land each year than the rest of Australia put together, and the rate at which it is destroying its vegetation is comparable with the infamous deforestation that occurs in the Brazilian Amazon. Brazil bulldozes about 0.25% of its part of the Amazon each year; Queensland clears about 0.45% of its remaining wooded areas. The recently re-elected Queensland Labor government has promised to change the laws. But in the meantime other states have begun to follow Queensland’s lead. In 2016 the New South Wales Coalition government announced it was going to axe three pieces of legislation that protected native vegetation and wildlife, and replace them with a single act that would make land clearing easier. A conservation scientist from the University of Queensland, Hugh Possingham, sat on the NSW government’s advisory board for the changes but resigned in protest, warning they could lead to a doubling of clearing rates in NSW. Possingham says exactly how much the laws will impact clearing rates is unclear, since there are other drivers of clearing, including climate and economics. “But if you look at Queensland, their example is so dramatic,” he says of the effects of law changes there. Daisy Barham, from the Nature Conservation Council of NSW, says the final set of laws and regulations released are even worse than those that caused the land clearing crisis in Queensland. “There are some really extreme elements in the NSW laws that don’t even feature in the Queensland laws,” she says. Barham says the worst is the “equity code” which leaves few controls on clearing of properties under 100 hectares, and where protected vegetation makes up less than 10% of the property. Analysis by WWF shows that could allow clearing of 8m hectares, or 38% of the remaining trees in the state, under that rule alone. The changes took effect in August 2017 but so far the government has refused to release data on how much clearing has taken place. In fact, official state data hasn’t been released since 2013-14, when about 30,000 hectares of trees were cleared in NSW. The area being cleared in there may seem small relative to Queensland, but NSW has a much smaller amount of remaining vegetation, with clearing there starting much earlier after colonisation. “Only 9% of NSW is in a healthy or near-natural condition,” Barham says. “We simply don’t have much left to lose. That is why every bit of clearing in NSW is so important.” Meanwhile, further north, vast tracts of land are being earmarked for clearing. In the relatively lawless Northern Territory, approvals for land clearing have jumped more than tenfold in the past two years, compared with the preceding 12 years, according to figures from the NT government analysed by the Wilderness Society. Some of the clearing approved for single properties in the NT is almost unimaginable in size. A property called Tipperary station has a total of 50,687 hectares approved for clearing through a number of separate applications over the past six years, an area almost 10 times the size of Manhattan on one property. David Morris, a lawyer who was chief executive of the Environmental Defenders Office NT until earlier this year, says the overarching feature of the Northern Territory’s land clearing is the lack of regulation. “It’s a totally inept regulatory regime,” says Morris, who is now chief executive of the Environmental Defenders Office NSW. He says land-clearing projects go through an environmental assessment framework, which the government has admitted is inadequate. “They’ve committed to reform it but in the meantime all approvals go through this very poor assessment regime.” In addition, major land-clearing proposals that occur on pastoral leases are assessed by a body called the Pastoral Lands Board, which adds further problems. “It is made up of four pastoralists and one rangelands scientist,” Morris says. “There is a very clear trend of increased approvals of broad-scale land clearing in the Northern Territory. And there is a regulatory regime that is incapable of dealing with the individual and cumulative impacts of that clearing.” “Having a board full of agricultural business people as the ultimate decision maker is mind-boggling,” says Glenn Walker, a Wilderness Society climate campaign manager. Glenn Walker, adding: “The NT has the worst regulation for deforestation of any jurisdiction in Australia.” And the spread of the land-clearing crisis doesn’t look set to stop in the NT. Some of Australia’s richest graziers are establishing cattle stations in Western Australia, and making claims for greater access to resources in the pristine Kimberley. Other states have their own clearing tragedies unfolding: some of Australia’s most majestic and oldest trees are being cut down for timber by a state-owned company in Victoria, which has even less left to lose than NSW. And Tasmania has just signed up to allow more logging in its national parks until at least 2037, a move NSW and Victoria are considering following. Combined, eastern Australia is considered a global deforestation hotspot, the only one in the developed world. According to analysis by WWF’s Martin Taylor, Australia is likely to lose 3m hectares of trees in the next 15 years. And all that is putting things Australians care most about under threat. “If you care about the Great Barrier Reef, then that’s what you care about,” he says. The effects of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef are multiplied by land clearing in Queensland, since it increases the amount of sediment that flows into rivers, and eventually on to the coral. That can starve them of light, and decrease their resilience to other impacts. WWF analysis estimated that 45 million animals are killed each year in Queensland, just from the bulldozing of their habitat. “People have very strong feelings about cruelty and mistreatment of animals,” Taylor says. “So what must they think of that then? That we’re bulldozing 45 million animals to death every year?” Both in Australia and around the world, habitat loss is by far the biggest threat to animals facing extinction. “If you care about koalas, and if you care about Australian wildlife – if you want your kids to see them – then that’s what you care about,” he says.\n",

      "Text: Avoiding the worst ravages of climate breakdown is still possible, and there are “multiple, feasible and effective options” for doing so, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said. Hoesung Lee, chair of the body, which is made up of the world’s leading climate scientists, made clear that – despite the widespread damage already being caused by extreme weather, and the looming threat of potentially catastrophic changes – the future was still humanity’s to shape. “[The IPCC reports] clearly show that humanity has the knowhow and the technology to tackle human-induced climate change. But not only that. They show that we have the capacity to build a much more prosperous, inclusive and equitable society in this process. “Tackling climate change is a hard, complex and enduring challenge for generations. We, the scientific community, spell out the facts of disheartening reality, but we also point to the prospects of hope through concerted, genuine and global transformational change.” Finance would be key, he said. The shift to a low-carbon economy would take between three and six times the amounts of funding currently devoted to green investment, according to the final section of the IPCC’s comprehensive sixth assessment report (AR6) of human knowledge of the climate. Climate justice would also be vital, the IPCC said, because the people being hit hardest by the impacts of the crisis were the poorest and most vulnerable who have done least to cause the problem. Aditi Mukherji, one of the 93 authors of the “synthesis report”, the final section that draws together the key findings, said: “Almost half the world’s population lives in regions that are highly vulnerable to climate change. In the last decade, deaths from floods, droughts and storms were 15 times higher in highly vulnerable regions.” This positive framing of a report that makes mostly very grim reading was a deliberate counterblast to the many voices that have said the world has little chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, the threshold beyond which many of the impacts of the crisis will rapidly become irreversible. Chris Jones, of the Met Office Hadley Centre, a member of the report’s core writing team, pointed out that emissions fell by 6% in 2020 owing to the Covid-19 lockdowns, and a similar fall would be needed each year for the next decade. “The scale of the challenge is massive,” he said. “If we keep emitting at the current rate, the carbon budget for 1.5C will be exhausted by 2030.” Monday’s publication may be the last this decade from the IPCC, which was set up in 1988 to assess global knowledge of the climate and advise on how human actions have been changing it. The IPCC AR6 report, which was delayed slightly owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, was published in three main sections from August 2021 to April 2022. The first three sections covered the underlying science of the climate system, the impacts of climate breakdown and the ways of tackling or reducing the problem, followed by Monday’s synthesis chapter drawing the previous three together. IPCC scientists and climate experts emphasised that this decade would be crucial, as decisions made now would affect the future of the planet for hundreds and perhaps thousands of years. Simon Stiell, the UN’s top climate official, said: “We are in a critical decade for climate action. Global emissions need to be reduced by nearly 43% by 2030 for the world to achieve the Paris agreement’s goal to limit global temperature rise to 2C and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. The synthesis report highlights just how far off-track we are.” But he added: “It’s not too late. The IPCC clearly demonstrates that it is possible to limit global warming to 1.5C with rapid and deep emissions reductions across all sectors of the global economy. It has given us many feasible, effective and low-cost mitigation and adaptation options to scale up across sectors and countries.” The message of action, rather than despair, was also taken up by the UN secretary-general, António Guterres. He called for countries to adopt an “acceleration agenda” involving all of the G20, the world’s biggest developed and developing countries. Developed countries must bring forward their commitments on reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions, from 2050 to “as close as possible to 2040”, said Guterres. Emerging economies, many of which have set net zero targets for the second half of this century, must also bring them forward, to “as close as possible” to 2050, he urged. This would require a major revision by some of the world’s biggest emitters: China currently has a target of before 2060, and India of 2070. Guterres also called for developed countries to phase out coal by 2030, and all others by 2040. He called for no new licensing or funding of oil and gas projects, based on the findings of the International Energy Agency that all new oil and gas development must cease for the world to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Achieving this will be a stretch, and many governments are likely to ignore these pleas, at least in the short term. Many experts were keen to point out that the price of renewable energy technology has fallen rapidly, making it a more attractive investment. But oil and gas companies have also been enjoying a record bonanza, and many are planning to reinvest the proceeds in more fossil fuels. Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change in the UK, said: “António Guterres is right to say that we need to rapidly increase the pace and urgency of the fight against the climate crisis. “In Britain, we have a Conservative government whose net zero strategy is so bad that it has been declared unlawful. The tragedy is that the Conservatives are holding us back from reaping the benefits of the green transition – lower energy bills, millions of good jobs, and a livable future for our children and grandchildren. “Labour will make Britain world leader in tackling the climate crisis, with our plan to make Britain a clean energy superpower by 2030, and by leading a clean power alliance across the world to create cleaner, greener energy.”\n",

      "Text: British food security is not being harmed by the spread of solar panels in the countryside as claimed by the UK’s environment secretary, documents from her own department reveal. Liz Truss told farmers last October that they would no longer receive agricultural subsidies for land that had solar power on, saying the “ugly” panels were “a blight on the countryside and villages” and were pushing production of meat and produce overseas. “I am committed to food production in this country and it makes my heart sink to see row upon row of solar panels where once there was a field of wheat or grassland for livestock to graze,” she was quoted as saying at the time. But environment department officials have admitted in private correspondence and documents released under freedom of information rules that they hold no data on the land covered in England by solar panels; they have no idea how much they will save in agricultural subsidies through the change; and the claim that solar power is harming food production does not stack up. “Given the small areas of land covered currently, it is not possible to argue that, at the national level, there is yet a serious impact on agricultural output,” they write in a document outlining the evidence for the policy. The documents reveal officials trying to guess how much farmland is affected by extrapolating from the total amount of solar installed across the country and the total amount of farmland nationally because detailed data for the crossover of solar and agricultural land does not exist. They also show the National Farmers Union opposed the change, with the farming body saying it believed solar panels could coexist with agricultural activity such as livestock grazing and even some arable crops. The officials speculate on how much farmers with solar panels are receiving by way of payments under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), but admit “we have no hard evidence to back these figures up”. Just two weeks before Truss made her announcement, one Defra official emailed colleagues saying they had no idea where to start looking for information on which large solar farms are also receiving agricultural payments. “Can either of you help with identifying some large scale solar farms in receipt of SPS subsidy? I don’t know where to begin with this!” the official wrote on 9 October 2014. Submissions from solar power developers argued that solar farms complement rather than compete with agriculture. “35GW of solar farms generating 10% of the UK’s electricity demand [nearly nine times the amount the UK has installed now] could be built on less than 1% of permanent pasture land without displacing any grazing sheep,” says a slide by British solar company AEE Renewables, now known as Green Hedge. Truss’s rhetoric in October was in line with her focus on championing British food since taking office last summer in which she has praised English and Welsh wine exports and penned comment articles lauding British apples. The sudden policy shift by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) added to the solar industry’s woes, coming just months after the Department of Energy and Climate Change had made drastic changes to the subsidy scheme for large solar farms. Sources in the solar industry said the Defra policy change appeared designed to woo Ukip voters. Leonie Greene, a spokeswoman for the Solar Trade Association, said: “What we want is an evidence-based approach to policy. The impact of solar farms is negligible in terms of land take, many times smaller than golf courses. We’ve taken great care as an industry to avoid conflict with food production, and the co-existence of farming for grazing or poultry on low grade land is clear.” Tess Sundelin, managing director at Green Hedge, told the Guardian: “These changes to CAP income are actually quite marginal for farmers. Our over-riding concern, given the significant income security and diversification that solar projects provide for the farming community, is the misconception amongst some policy makers about the land that solar farms cover.” A Defra spokeswoman did not address the contradiction between Truss’s public statements and her officials in private, but said: “The government believes that the country’s highest quality land should be used for food and crop production. That is why we have taken the decision to remove Common Agricultural Policy payment from land used to generate energy through solar panels. This further protects our land, farmers and food security through redistributing payments to those farming the land and who are committed to agriculture.”\n",

      "Text: If it did nothing else, the emergence of Covid-19 a year ago underlined for all of us the importance of anticipating and preparing for – and, as appropriate, steering the course of – things that might happen in the future. That is, in a nutshell, the goal of the 2021 horizon scan of emerging global biological conservation issues recently published in the journal Trends in Ecology & Evolution by the Cambridge University conservation biologist William Sutherland and a team of 24 other conservation practitioners and researchers from around the world. The team started by identifying 97 trends with potentially large impacts on conservation and biodiversity, then trimmed the list down to the top 15 that they agreed “society may urgently need to address”. “Recent global assessments of biological diversity and climate change indicate negative trends and a rapidly narrowing window for action to reverse these trends,” the researchers wrote. “We believe that identification of novel or emerging issues for global biological conservation should inform policymaking.” The 2021 horizon scan is the latest in a series that stretches back more than a decade. In addition to making their predictions for the year ahead, the team members reviewed selections from the first horizon scan, published in 2009. They found that one-third of the issues identified in that scan “have since developed into major issues or caused considerable environmental impacts”. Here are the issues that bubbled to the top in this year’s scan: Coral reefs have come under siege from many threats in recent decades, from invasive species to warming waters to harmful fishing practices. Increasingly worrisome is hypoxia-associated coral mortality – suffocation from a lack of oxygen due to an influx of nutrients from land or aquaculture facilities into ocean waters. Because warm water holds less oxygen than cold water, scientists fear that climate change will only make this problem worse. Deoxygenation of ocean waters has already harmed corals in relatively small spaces such as bays and lagoons. Although we know relatively little about how resilient corals might be to low oxygen, there is concern that in some cases it could be the last straw for these valuable and beleaguered ecosystems. Ocean coastlines are abundant sources of plant and animal life – and those in polar zones are becoming increasingly so due to climate change-induced melting of glacial and floating ice that contains relatively large amounts of iron. Plants need iron to photosynthesise, so melting ice stimulates plant growth. This increases coastal ecosystems’ ability to soak up planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and potentially harmful nutrients running off land, and boosts the food supply for other living things in the area. But as the trend continues, it is also likely to alter biodiversity and ecosystem structure and complexity along polar coastlines in unknown ways, even as it enhances biological communities’ ability to mitigate climate change through carbon sequestration. Heads up, ocean ecosystems: global energy trends are about to bring big waves of change. Numerous offshore oil and gas rigs as well as first-generation offshore wind turbines are slated for decommissioning in the near future. A variety of strategies could be deployed for doing so, from removing all or part of an installation, to converting it to an artificial reef, to simply abandoning it. At the same time, new ocean-based wind energy installations and natural gas wells will be coming online. These changes in ocean-sited infrastructure could have a big impact on habitat in the vicinity – for better, for worse or for both, depending on the location, the extent to which existing infrastructure has been colonised by marine life, and specific implementation strategies. Ocean-going vessels carrying out illegal fishing activities have ways of covering their tracks, from deactivating electronic tracking systems to avoiding the use of lights at night. The difficulty of finding such covertly operating boats on the vast open seas can be a limiting factor in efforts to prevent illegal activities that lead to overfishing and biodiversity degradation. In an interesting twist on surveillance, scientists are looking at enlisting albatrosses and other ocean-going birds to help track down troublemakers. The birds, which follow fishing vessels in hopes of grabbing morsels, can be fitted with transmitters that can help enforcement officials to find them. Work is already under way to evaluate the approach – including consideration of the extent to which it might put the birds themselves at risk of harm. Although seabirds may be attracted to fishing boats, they’re not quite as helpful when it comes to tracking vessels that aren’t flinging fish bits off the back. It is possible to identify and pinpoint the location of most such ships using global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and automatic identification systems (AIS). However, technologies are emerging that allow those wishing to avoid detection due to surreptitious activities to muddle their identification and coordinates. Conservation biologists speculate that such technologies could make it easier to illegally transport animals or animal parts, engage in illegal mining or conduct other covert activities. Efforts are under way to develop technologies to thwart such deceptive practices, but it could be a decade before they are ready to deploy. It’s bad enough for pollutants to harm animals that come in contact with them. But now there is evidence that some water-polluting chemicals that alter endocrine systems in fish can get passed to future generations as well. By mimicking or blocking the proper function of hormones, such compounds, which include many used in households and on farms, can cause deformities and fertility issues. And now it appears that in some species, parents can pass those disruptions to the next generation. Concerns are growing that this long-tail impact will be found in other animals as well. Among the little-known prospective victims of climate change are the low clouds that hang over coastal oceans near the equator, helping to cool the atmosphere. The nature and extent of these clouds depend on a variety of conditions that are expected to change as our climate warms, including ocean temperatures, air movement in the atmosphere and the layout of coastal lands. Changes in the cloud cover, in turn, could affect the clouds’ ability to counteract global heating and preserve the conditions in which human settlements and ecosystems have evolved to thrive, and could exacerbate fire risk in the region. Numerous groups have begun promoting extensive planting of carbon dioxide-absorbing trees as a way to help counter the climate-disrupting rise in the concentration of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere. But massive tree-planting efforts are not without concerns. Even as proponents tout the approach to climate change mitigation, others warn of potential problems. For one thing, poorly sited plantations could end up replacing ecosystems that sequestered more carbon than the trees do. For another, biodiversity could take a hit in the process as species-rich native habitats are replaced by monoculture plantations with the primary goal of sucking away CO2. Careful planning will be needed to ensure such initiatives don’t do more harm than good in the long run. As climate and other conditions change, the intensity and severity of wildfires are increasing in North America, Australia, central Africa and elsewhere around the world. One strategy that has been proposed to cut the risk is to reduce the number of trees available to burn. Some research suggests that such a strategy could do little to decrease the likelihood of harm to humans and property, and in some instances could even increase it. Nevertheless, with strong public pressure to do something about this growing problem, there is a real likelihood that policymakers will turn to tree thinning as a way to prevent wildfires – with certain but unknown impacts on the ecosystem and multiple species that call forests home. A quiet revolution is under way in India: the large-scale adoption of sustainable intensification as a farming practice. Across the world’s second most populous country, state-level policies are incentivising farmers to adopt a suite of practices that reduce the adverse environmental impacts of agriculture while boosting crop yields, income, health and wellbeing. To date, more than a quarter of a million farmers have adopted the new approach, which includes eliminating synthetic inputs, enhancing crop diversity, rotating crops and more. Millions more are expected to follow the practice, which is also known as natural, community-based or zero-budget farming. As success stories roll in, the initiatives could set off a snowball effect, leading other countries and farmers to follow suit. If you have ever mistaken a satellite for a star in the night sky, you’ve had a taste of the confusion scientists fear might face some birds, mammals and insects in the future. About 2,600 artificial satellites circle our planet, and booming communications technologies are expected to catalyse the deployment of thousands more. What do these plentiful extra points of light mean for animals that use the stars for navigational cues? No one knows for sure – but it’s a question worth investigating before permanent damage is done to populations already beleaguered by human impacts on the surface of the Earth. At certain times and in certain places around the world, the ability to generate electricity exceeds demand, as limited by economics or logistics. The excess capacity – whether methane byproducts from oil drilling or wind or solar power that exceeds local demand – may just go to waste due to market logistics. But what if a pop-up demand were available to use this “stranded energy” on an as-needed basis, at a discounted (but better than throwing it away) price? Recently, bitcoin mining – an energy-intensive process required to keep transactions fair – has been emerging as a possible contender. Bitcoin mining is relatively flexible when it comes to time and place, so it could create a use for these resources that gives a low payout but is better than nothing. There is some concern by those working to mitigate biodiversity-compromising climate change that using bitcoin to close the use-capacity gap could boost use of fossil fuels – but there is also optimism that it may help to make renewable energy sources more economically desirable. If officials don’t notice or respond to environmental problems, are they still problems? Environmental quality in many regions around the world is limited by insufficient monitoring, detection, prevention and mitigation of pollution or other assaults. But that could change, thanks to emerging technologies. Because of the growing adoption of smartphones and internet connectivity, private citizens around the world are being empowered to act as environmental detectives, identifying and calling out problems they identify through social media mining. This approach has already been used to document locust swarms in east Africa. As more and more people connect, it could be applied around the world to detect and encourage responses to environmental assaults of all sorts, from water pollution to wildlife poaching. The development of self-healing building materials bodes well for biodiversity in a variety of ways. Such materials, which are based on a variety of inputs, including chemicals and bacteria, aim to enhance the ability of built structures to bounce back from damage without the need to repair or replace them. They could be beneficial in a number of ways. For one, they can cut greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the need to produce concrete and carry out construction projects to repair or replace damaged structures. For another, they can reduce the need to mine or quarry new materials, processes that often involve destroying habitat for plants, animals and other living things. In addition, they can shrink the production of construction debris and the accompanying increased demand for landfill space. A 1,200-mile (2,000km) river-and-canal system will have environmental impacts under any circumstances. But conservation biologists are particularly concerned about the one being considered for connecting the Baltic and Black seas in Europe. Known as the E40 Waterway, it would cross the Polesia wilderness area, one of the largest in Europe, and probably affect more than 70 wildlife reserves and conservation areas. It also would pass near, and potentially disrupt, the Chernobyl exclusion zone and radioactive materials in the area. The project, which is already in motion, is expected to have numerous economic, social and environmental benefits. However, it also carries risk to biodiversity in terms of disrupted ecology and hydrology, and enhanced dispersion of non-native invasive species. This article was originally published by Ensia\n",

      "Text: A new analysis shows US greenhouse gas levels are increasing as the Trump administration unravels efforts to slow climate change. Carbon emissions rose sharply last year, increasing 3.4%, according to new estimates from the economic firm Rhodium Group. That year’s jump in emissions is the biggest since the bounce back from the recession in 2010. It is the second largest gain in more than two decades. Coal plants are shutting down, but electricity demand is growing. Natural-gas fired power emits about half as much carbon as coal but still contributes to climate change. The fossil fuel is replacing most of the coal plants that are closing and also fed most of the higher demand, increasing power-sector climate pollution. Outside of the power sector, transportation, industry and buildings all increased their emissions as well, according to the estimates. The numbers undercut one of the Trump administration’s key defenses for dismissing federal science reports that show rising temperatures will wreak havoc on the economy, kill people and cause more extreme weather. Trump has said he doesn’t believe the findings and his officials have argued they are exaggerated. The Environmental Protection Agency chief, Andrew Wheeler, often trumpets declines in greenhouse gases, citing data showing that they fell 2.7% from 2016 to 2017. But the EPA is rescinding Obama-era climate work, including regulations meant to speed a shift from coal. The agency contends that Donald Trump’s agenda is driving energy innovation that could help cut emissions. Energy experts, however, say Trump is doing the opposite by rolling back the rules and policies that could have sped renewable growth and by forgoing new regulations beyond the electricity sector. Rhodium Group tracks the most prevalent greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. The firm found a modest decrease in carbon emissions between 2016 and 2017, in part because of a warmer-than-usual winter that didn’t require as much heating. Since then carbon output has surged. “The tailwinds of Obama administration policy are dissipating,” said Trevor Houser, a partner at the firm. “This year makes it abundantly clear that energy market trends alone – the low cost of natural gas, the increasing competitiveness of renewables – are not enough to deliver sustained declines in US emissions.” Houser said the numbers would have been worse without the state and local policies enacted during the past five to 10 years. But that the groundswell of climate commitments by governors and mayors since Trump said he would exit the international Paris climate agreement might not translate into policy for some time, he added. He said those efforts are likely to be significant but not sufficient to meet the levels the US pledged.\n",

      "Text: Former officials in the UN’s farming wing have said they were censored, sabotaged, undermined and victimised for more than a decade after they wrote about the hugely damaging contribution of methane emissions from livestock to global heating. Team members at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) tasked with estimating cattle’s contribution to soaring temperatures said that pressure from farm-friendly funding states was felt throughout the FAO’s Rome headquarters and coincided with attempts by FAO leadership to muzzle their work. The allegations date back to the years after 2006, when some of the officials who spoke exclusively to the Guardian on condition of anonymity wrote Livestock’s Long Shadow (LLS), a landmark report that pushed farm emissions on to the climate agenda for the first time. LLS included the first tally of the meat and dairy sector’s ecological cost, attributing 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions to livestock, mostly cattle. It shocked an industry that had long seen the FAO as a reliable ally – and spurred an internal clampdown by FAO hierarchy, according to the officials. “The lobbyists obviously managed to influence things,” one ex-official said. “They had a strong impact on the way things were done at the FAO and there was a lot of censorship. It was always an uphill struggle getting the documents you produced past the office for corporate communications and one had to fend off a good deal of editorial vandalism.” Serving and former FAO experts said that between 2006 and 2019, management made numerous attempts to suppress investigations into the cow/climate change connection. Top officials rewrote and diluted key passages in another report on the same topic, “buried” another paper critical of big agriculture, excluded critical officials from meetings and summits, and briefed against their work. “There was substantial pressure internally and there were consequences for permanent staff who worked on this, in terms of their careers. It wasn’t really a healthy environment to work in,” said another ex-official. Scientists also expressed concern about the way the FAO’s estimate of livestock’s overall contribution to emissions is continuing to fall. The 18% number that was published in 2006 was revised downwards to 14.5% in a follow-up paper, Tackling Climate Change Emissions in 2013. It is currently being assessed at about 11.2% based on a new “Gleam 3.0” model. But many scientists plot farm emissions on a very different trajectory. One recent study concluded that greenhouse gas emissions from animal products made up 20% of the global total and a 2021 study found that the figure should be between 16.5% and 28.1%. A recent paper by Matthew Hayek, the assistant professor in environmental sciences at New York University, said that the FAO’s use of emissions modeling – without using verifiable atmospheric data – could underestimate methane emissions from livestock by up to 47% in countries such as the US. “Models are only estimates that need to be constantly validated – and there’s been an alarming lack of validation over the now decades that this [FAO] research has been produced,” he said. Anne Mottet, the FAO’s livestock development officer, stressed that the changing figures reflected best practices and evolving methodologies, rather than an assumed cut in livestock numbers. “Livestock is part of the FAO’s strategy on climate change and we work with governments and farmers and industry on this programme as well,” she said. “We can’t ignore the main actors of the sector but there has been no particular pressure from them.” The new report’s methodology had produced more accurate figures because “we have access to better data and tools and the IPCC calculations for emissions are also being improved and updated regularly”, she added. The Guardian conducted in-depth interviews with about 20 former and current FAO officials, and corroborated their accounts as far as possible. Speaking anonymously, the officials described a culture in which attempts to probe the connection between livestock and climate change were discouraged and, in some cases, suppressed, and where management attempted to sabotage research and research networks. Henning Steinfeld, the head of the FAO’s livestock analysis unit, said that diplomats and meat lobbyists talked to senior FAO managers and encouraged them not to invest in work that dealt with environmental impacts. “It’s not that anyone would come to you and say: ‘Stop this! We don’t like this work,’” the source said, describing the working environment. “They would just make your work difficult. They would not invite you to a meeting with a donor. You would not get a slot when you should be speaking. You would not get the support from project development, from capacity building, from all kinds of other units in the FAO that others would get.” Jennifer Jacquet, professor of environmental science at the University of Miami, suggested it was “no coincidence” that the FAO had rowed back on its appraisal of farm emissions, given the pressures recounted by former officials. “It’s a story as old as time, that the meat and dairy industry has enormous influence over the policymaking apparatus,” she said. FAO data was a “prime source” of data for the UN International Panel on Climate Change’s last report on forestry and agriculture, according to its lead author, Gert Jan Nabuurs. The organisation’s current focus is on making sure that scientific innovation is made as available as possible for farmers around the world. In September it hosted the first global conference on sustainable livestock transformation, which looked at animal feed, precision farming and animal genetic resources, with the goal of “sharing information about good practices and initiatives to make optimal use of natural resources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions”. It has also, for the first time, set itself the aim of trying to outline how food systems must change for the world to stay within the globally agreed goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The FAO and several meat and dairy industry lobbyists declined to comment for this story.  This article was amended on 24 October 2023. A previous version said a paper found that the FAO’s model could underestimate methane emissions from livestock by up to 90%; that should have been 47%.\n",

      "Text: A pioneering research project to clean up a flooded Cornish tin mine is using algae to harvest the precious heavy metals in its toxic water, while simultaneously producing biofuel. If the project, which is at a very early stage, is proven to work, it could have huge environmental benefits around the world. The GW4 Alliance, which brings together the universities of Bath, Bristol, Cardiff and Exeter, in collaboration with Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML), the Coal Authority and waste management group Veolia, is taking untreated mine water samples from the Wheal Jane tin mine in Cornwall and growing algae in them in a laboratory. The alliance is exploring whether the algae is effective in removing harmful materials, such as arsenic and cadmium, from the mine water. Researchers hope to convert the algae into a solid from which heavy metals can be extracted and recycled for use in the electronics industry. The remaining solid waste will then be used to make biofuels. “It’s a win-win solution to a significant environmental problem,” said Dr Chris Chuck from the University of Bath’s Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies. “We’re putting contaminated water in and taking out valuable metals, clean water and producing fuel.” The Wheal Jane mine, near Truro, closed in 1992. But the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs is still spending £2m a year on cleaning it up and combating its polluting effects. The project to clean up its acidic water using algae is thought to be the first of its kind in the world. Dead algae has been used to filter water but the Wheal Jane project uses live algae found at the site to “remediate” its toxic water. The scientists had initially been interested in the ability of reeds in the flooded area around the mine to absorb toxic substances. But then they started examining the algae on the reeds and realised that it had special properties. “Some of the algae we’ve found in the Wheal Jane site can actually absorb a lot of the metals that are there,” Chuck explained. “What we don’t quite know are what metals are being absorbed into the [algae] cell and what are sticking to the cell.” If successful, the scientists believe the technology could be used to treat many forms of environmental pollution. The team has just received funding to take its work to Vietnam, where it will examine whether algae can be used to treat industrial effluent. A cheap, efficient way of cleaning up old mines would be eagerly sought by countries around the world. “Acidic waste run-off from mines is not a regional issue restricted to Cornwall, it’s a global problem,” said Dr Mike Allen, director of the Algal Biotechnology and Innovation Centre at PML. “It’s a particular problem in the developing world, where costly clean-up and remediation activities are ignored because of their high cost and low return. “By making the clean-up process pay for itself, we can improve both the health and the environment of millions of people around the world.” The team hopes to begin a pilot project at the mine in the new year. The aim will then be to scale it up. Ensuring the technology can work on a large scale is considered crucial to its viability. It is well established that biofuel can be created from algae but the processing costs are so high that it is not considered economically viable. By scaling up the project, those behind it hope production costs can be brought down significantly. But this will involve the cultivation of large amounts of algae. “We will need a lot of land,” Chuck explained. “The question we need to answer is how can we grow algae in the smallest space possible?” If this question can be answered, then the pilot project at the mine could provide a sustainable business model for tackling pollution, with money raised from biomass production offsetting the cost of algae cultivation. “By growing algae in mine water, which is currently expensive to remediate, we are providing an alternative economic model to traditional algal cultivation,” said Dr Chris Bryan, lecturer in sustainable mining and minerals resourcing at the University of Exeter’s Environment and Sustainability Institute. “The aim is to reduce the treatment costs while generating value at the same time from the algal biomass.” However, turning the treated water into usable fuel will be a significant challenge. The water has to be heated at very high temperatures and under high pressure so that nitrogen can be removed. With so many obstacles to overcome, Chuck is wary of talking up the project. But he stressed that its huge potential lay in using natural resources to treat a significant and stubborn environmental problem. “We are using what’s already there in the environment,” he said. “We are not using GM or anything. We would never advocate using foreign species because we would not know what their impact would be.”\n",

      "Text: At the UN climate conference in Paris in December 2015, 195 countries concluded a groundbreaking climate accord. They agreed to limit global warming to well below 2C to avoid extremely dangerous and irreversible climate change. The international community’s remaining emission “budget” is less than 1,000 gigatonnes of CO2. The Paris agreement is intended to ensure as quickly as possible that the annual global emissions go down, the budget is stretched, and the net emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced to zero over a few decades. The challenge of limiting the combustion of oil, coal and gas to this budget is enormous in view of the fossil reserves still underground. If we were to use all the known and probable reserves to generate energy, global emissions would amount to around 15,000 gigatonnes of CO2. So limiting global warming to 2C means this: of the 15,000 thousand gigatonnes of CO2, we need to leave at least 14,000 underground. Truly, our problem is not a scarcity of fossil resources, it is the exact opposite. We lack an exit strategy for oil, coal and gas. Energy efficiency and renewable energy are indispensable parts of a response to climate change, but they do not tell us why private companies and private individuals should stop extracting, marketing and consuming fossil fuels. In fact, the progress made on energy efficiency and renewables can actually exacerbate the problem. An oversupply of fossil resources lowers the price and makes it even more tempting to use them. And the temptation is great: the fossil energy industry offers profits, jobs and low energy prices. The Paris agreement says this to our children and grandchildren: “We promise not to expose you to the dangers of climate change.” If we are to keep our word, we have no alternative to decarbonisation. Our production and consumption must become carbon-neutral. There is an international consensus that the industrialised countries need to lead the way. Germany does not need to change its climate and energy transition targets in view of the decisions made in Paris. There is a consensus amongst the political parties represented in the Bundestag that Germany will reduce greenhouse gases by 80-95% by 2050 from the 1990 baseline. The Federal government and the Bundestag have decided on the following interim goals: greenhouse gas emissions are to be down 40% by 2020, 55% by 2030, and 70% by 2040. We should regard this challenge as an opportunity for a comprehensive modernisation of our economy. The fossil fuels are being substituted by investment in efficiency technologies and renewable energy. Here, a key role will be played by digitisation. In short: we will replace oil, coal and gas with intelligence and sustainable investment by 2050 at the latest. By doing this, we will be creating high-quality growth and jobs. If this transformation is to become a success story not only in climate terms, but also in economic terms, in the coming decades, we will need a paradigm shift. The most important aspect is to avoid misallocated investments. We want to complete the switch by 2050, which gives us three-and-a-half decades. Investments in fossil structures with a lifespan extending beyond 2050 will become stranded assets of the respective companies, and will require us to undertake expensive repairs in future. A forward-looking approach to modernisation which avoids lock-in effects, subsequent destruction of capital, and job losses, must put the right policies in place right now. We should therefore declare efficiency and renewable energy to be the new “rule”, the new standard investment. Investments in fossil structures must become the exception. We should only undertake them in cases where we have no alternative technologies or where the alternatives are disproportionately expensive. We need to reverse the rule-exception relationship: that is the paradigm shift. What does the new “rule” – investment in energy efficiency and renewables – mean for the various sectors? Power generation still accounts for by far the largest proportion of greenhouse gases. The sector is also set to grow as the decarbonisation of the heating and transport sectors will only be possible if we use more electricity. This electricity needs to stem from zero-carbon renewable sources, particularly wind and photovoltaics. We need to keep investing in these technologies. Fossil fuel power stations have a lifespan of 40 years or more. To avoid misallocated investment which reach far beyond 2050 and to avoid lock-in effects, we should urgently dispense with new coal-fired power plants and extensions to opencast mines. Gas-fired power stations with comparatively small carbon emissions fall into the “exceptions” category, because we need them as controllable power stations for our energy security; however, natural gas will have to be replaced gradually by zero-carbon. Of all CO2-relevant emissions, buildings have the longest lifespans, at around 100 years. We should therefore define an efficiency standard for all new buildings which, when coupled with the direct use of renewable energy and electricity, results in zero carbon emissions. We already have the necessary technologies and they are already affordable, so that this new standard can be introduced with just a few years’ notice. The challenges in the existing building stock are far greater. These buildings are dominated by gas-fired and oil-fired combustion systems which mostly heat buildings which are only moderately insulated. In the short term, a switch to using efficient condensing boilers can save a lot of CO2 emissions. As heating systems have a lifespan of 20 years, from 2030 investment in fossil fuel heating systems should stop so that we can finish the transition by 2050. The only cost-efficient way to do this is to combine it with appropriate insulation of the building envelope. The transport sector may pose the greatest challenge. Most of the rail system has already been electrified, but almost all passenger and freight traffic on the road, in the air and on water is almost entirely dependent on fossil fuels. Electric mobility offers us the chance to achieve the energy transition in the field of private transport. With an average lifespan of 20 years we need to have switched from fossil-based to renewables-based engines by 2030 if we are to stop using gasoline and diesel on our roads in 2050. The emissions of newly bought vehicles must then amount to zero. We need a road map which enables the state and the automotive industry to draw up an ambitious investment strategy for the transport sector. The paradigm shift in the energy transition cannot be applied to all sectors. The process-related industrial emissions, and the methane emissions from agriculture, cannot be avoided by higher efficiency or a switch to renewable energy. These emissions will continue unless we manage to develop alternative technologies. But by far the largest proportion of our emissions is produced by burning oil, coal and gas. For this reason, a cost-efficient energy transition should be oriented to investment cycles with a view to a far-reaching decarbonisation by the middle of the century. Investments in efficiency and renewable energy must become the rule, and investment in fossil structures the exception with clearly defined timelines for an exit. By adopting this forward-looking policy, we will avoid misallocations of investment and lock-in effects. It will enable Germany to follow a sustainable path of growth– whereas a continuation of investment in fossil fuels brings incalculable economic risks. In the aftermath of Paris, we are now seeing a race between nations to adopt the smartest and most cost-efficient modernisation policies. Thanks to its energy transition, Germany has a lead. We will have to work hard if we are to maintain this lead.\n",

      "Text: Your article (PM to put nuclear power at heart of UK’s energy strategy, 6 April) refers to Sizewell C as one of the major projects that has “already been through some form of planning”. The planning process is still going on, and thousands of interested parties have objected. Six months of Planning Inspectorate meetings exposed the mistakes of trying to build two gigantic reactors in the middle of an area of outstanding natural beauty and site of special scientific interest, pushed against the Minsmere nature reserve, on an eroding coastline, and with no available water for construction or operation, among other problems. This hasn’t stopped Kwasi Kwarteng promising millions in taxpayer funding for Sizewell C when the planning process has not been completed and while he refuses to meet the community to hear alternative views.Josie BassinetteWalberswick, Suffolk  In your major article on the government’s new energy strategy there is no mention of a major reason for opposing more nuclear power: there is still no method of disposing of highly toxic nuclear waste safely. This is hugely irresponsible with regard to future generations, unlike some indigenous Americans like the Iroquois, who have a principle that every plan of action must be considered with regard to its effect on the next seven generations.Morag CarmichaelLondon  In light of Boris’s new enthusiasm for lots of Rolls-Royce’s so-called “mini-nukes” to generate electricity, it should be better known that the Ministry of Defence has not scrapped any of its 21 similarly Rolls-Royce-powered old nuclear submarines, berthed for up to 40 years. It has made a start dismantling the hull of one, but there are still no plans for dealing with the reactors beyond burying them. Indeed, no country in the world has properly made safe a worn out mini-nuke-powered ship or submarine.Bob CannellBradford  I would argue that we do not need new nuclear power at all. It is costly, dangerous, slow and unsuitable as an adjunct to renewables. We certainly don’t need it in Wales. In 2021, planning inspectors advised that the Wylfa Newydd development (What might the UK energy strategy contain and how feasible are options?, 6 April) should be rejected due to its impact on the local economy, housing stock, local ecology, nature conservation and the Welsh language. Yet still politicians say it’s the best place for a new nuclear power station. No wonder Boris Johnson wants to cut the “red tape” of the planning process. He cannot be allowed to.Linda RogersLlangoed, Anglesey  If the government is considering investment in long-term non-fossil energy projects like nuclear, why does its strategy make no mention of tidal power? Proven technology at a variety of suitable sites around the UK could provide baseload renewable electricity. True, the old Severn Barrage scheme raised fears for wildlife, but better design and the realisation that climate change will do far worse damage to wildlife should still such fears.Jon ReedsAlston, Cumbria  A quick win for additional energy supplies should be expansion of anaerobic digestion plants running on waste organic materials. This is a known and improving technology that can be scaled up and built quickly on farms. Organic waste materials can be sourced from farms, food factories, kerbside collections, verge and hedge cutting, etc. This process would be a better use of forestry waste than inefficient burning for electricity as it produces gas for the grid, from where it would be used much more efficiently, and fertiliser that is currently made from fossil fuel gas. CO2 can also be captured to replace that currently made from fossil fuel gas.Malcolm ScottWirral  There are several glaring omissions from the energy strategy, including our ability to produce energy from waste (EfW) and our ability to sell UK EfW products to UK customers. As a nation, we are embarrassingly behind Europe on this matter, and to our shame we are sending waste either to landfill or to other countries to produce energy from. This, coupled with a ridiculous red tape system in the UK means that we (and companies like ours) are also more likely to sell our EfW pellets to Europe while UK power plants import pellets made from wood from other countries.Ian JonesCEO, Waste Knot Energy  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

      "Text: As someone who actively campaigns for environmental protection, I admire George Monbiot, but his attack on the excellent film Six Inches of Soil seems to suggest that he is prepared to assault any idea that does not conform to his apparently very limited worldview (There’s no such thing as a benign beef farm – so beware the ‘eco-friendly’ new film straight out of a storybook, 15 April). First, the film is primarily about how we can improve and protect our soils, which for many years have been degraded by the overuse of agrochemicals and overproduction. Regenerative farming aims to improve soil quality, increase biodiversity and allow farmers to grow food for us while making a profit. I would have thought these are aims that Monbiot would heartily endorse. Instead he focuses on the beef farmer in the film and his contribution to the climate crisis. Second, yes, cattle farming is a major contributor to greenhouse gases, but the real villains are the big food lots in the US, Brazil and elsewhere. The regenerative farmer keeps beef and dairy cattle as part of the farm’s ecosystem, using the manure to fertilise fields that would otherwise be covered in artificial fertiliser, much of it produced by fossil fuels. The keeping of animals on a small scale encourages greater biodiversity, improves animal welfare and produces high-quality beef or milk. In the long term, regenerative farmers are encouraging less frequent consumption of meat of a higher quality, which has to be better for us and the environment. It is naive to expect farmers to completely rewild their land – they need to make money and we need food. Rather than attack those who are trying to improve their farming methods, let us celebrate the regenerative farmers who are making real improvements to the ways in which we produce food and look after our countryside.Rev Richard StainerWorld development adviser, diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich, Suffolk\n",

      "Text: As Fiona Harvey reported for The Guardian, the International Energy Agency (IEA) 2012 World Energy Outlook Report found that annual carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels rose 1.4 percent in 2012 to 31.6 billion tonnes (gigatonnes [Gt]). The bad news is that this is a new record high level of emissions. The good news is that it represents the second-smallest annual increase since 2003, behind only 2009 when global fossil fuel carbon emissions fell due to the global recession. Emissions estimates from 2009–2010 have also been revised downward, so the reported 31.6 Gt 2012 emissions match the reported value from 2011. American emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels fell by 200 million tonnes (Mt) to levels last seen in the mid-1990s due to a transition from coal power to natural gas and renewable energy. European emissions fell 50 Mt due to economic contraction and renewable energy growth, despite an increase in coal energy use. Perhaps most encouraging, although Chinese emissions grew by 300 Mt in 2012, this was among the country's smallest annual emissions growth over the past decade. This is a result of China diversifying its energy sources and installing more renewable energy. The IEA report comes on the heels of an agreement between the presidents of USA and China to reduce emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are potent greenhouse gases. This could potentially lead to the reduction the equivalent of 90 Gt of carbon dioxide by 2050, or nearly three years of current global emissions from fossil fuel use. China is also considering putting a price on its carbon emissions, and their goal is to end the rapid growth of Chinese coal power use. So there are signs that the world's two largest greenhouse gas emitters, USA and China are beginning to take serious steps to address the climate problem. The question is whether those steps will be large enough and fast enough to avoid triggering dangerous climate change. At the moment, we our emissions are closest to Scenario A2 from the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. Scenario A2 represents 3 to 4°C global surface warming by 2100 as compared to pre-industrial levels. This far exceeds the internationally accepted 2°C \"danger limit\", and would put us at serious risk of catastrophic climate change. However, the relatively small emissions increase in 2012 has pushed us in the direction of IPCC scenario A1T, which represents 2 to 3°C warming by 2100. That still exceeds the danger limit, but at least it's movement in the right direction. More still needs to be done to reduce our fossil fuel consumption. To have a realistic chance of avoiding 2°C warming, emissions need to peak by the year 2020. The earlier they peak, the better chance we have of limiting the impacts of climate change to an adaptable level. This will be challenging, because power plants have lifetimes of many decades, so we're already \"locked in\" to a substantial chunk of emissions from those that have already been constructed or are in construction. The IEA report presented four recommendations for limiting global warming to 2°C: 1) Increase energy efficiency in buildings, transportation, and industry.  2) Limit the construction and use of inefficient coal power plants.  3) Minimize methane emissions from oil and gas production.  4) Accelerate the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies. The positive movement from China and the USA in particular is encouraging, but we still have a lot of work ahead to turn the annual carbon emissions growth into an annual decline in order to limit the climate damage to adaptable levels.\n",

      "Text: Australia’s first rescued-food supermarket has opened in Sydney, providing donated or surplus produce to customers on a pay-what-they-can basis, in an effort to reduce the estimated $8bn to $10bn of food discarded each year. The OzHarvest Market provides food, from blemished apples to frozen sausage rolls, as well as other items such as sanitary products and toothpaste, which would otherwise be thrown out, sourced from the excess of major supermarket chains, caterers and cafes. In a small store in the suburb of Kensington, volunteers stack bulk displays of microwave spaghetti bolognese, Weet-Bix, noodles and rice. Fresh eggplant, mushrooms and a lone pineapple sit next to a rack of canned vegetables, while staff chat about how the big mover today seems to be green curry paste. Julie, a mother of two also babysitting her nephew, the store’s first ever customer, was returning for her second visit. “At the moment I’m experiencing some real financial hardship,” she said. “This is a place where I can come and pay a bit of money and still be able to get my shopping done. To go into a supermarket, the money goes very quickly.” “There are some things I can’t get here, they don’t have cheese or Halal meat, but it takes stress off the cost of the bill at the supermarket. While I’m in this financial hardship, I’d like to come here twice a week.” The market also stocks hygiene products, baby formula, toothpaste, shampoo and a mobile charging card that provides access to Ask Izzy, a directory of homelessness support services. Sarah, a customer who came with her infant daughter Millie, said she was pleasantly surprised by the baby supplies on offer. “When I saw that they had these here, it was a really big relief. The thing is, I was looking to buy these at the supermarket and they’re reasonably priced but still a bit over my budget. It takes the pressure off a little bit.” Jun, an international student at the nearby University of New Wales said she bought $20 worth of food, including coffee, curry paste and snacks, for $5. “It’s a good way to save money. I’m very close to my final exam and I stopped my part-time job, meaning my income has been reduced”. Alicia Kirwan, OzHarvest’s NSW manager, said the store has between five and 10 volunteers a shift and serves 150 people a day but expects more. Small signs around the store give food preservation tips (“Onions going bad? Simply dice and freeze.”) Michelle is a retiree who volunteers at the market once a week.  “OzHarvest really drew me in with their food reclamation,” she said. “I just don’t like it when you walk into a regular supermarket and 30% of food is going to be thrown away. It’s terrible. I love the initiative of reclaiming food and providing people with food if they need it. “I like the big solid meals that provide nourishment for a whole family. One lady came in and I said ‘What do you like to cook?’, and she grabbed some noodles and said ‘I’d like to make a really huge pad thai’. I’d like to imagine her going home and making a huge pad thai”. Kirwan said the market receives 20 to 30 loaves of bread a day from the Bread and Butter Project, which provides baking apprenticeships and employment for asylum seekers. “Our bread is beautiful, we get their thirteenth loaf from their bakers dozen,” she said. She said the market would operate in its Kensington location for as long it has the site, which sits beneath a newly-established youth shelter, but was looking to find other sites to replicate the set-up.\n",

      "Text: A majority of Australians, including Coalition voters, support taxing the super profits of the booming oil and gas industry, according to an authoritative annual survey. The latest Climate of the Nation survey of voters – now in its 15th year and managed by the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute – shows 61% of 2,691 respondents would back a windfall tax. The proposal captures majority support across all age, state, gender and voting intention demographics, with the exception of One Nation voters. The Albanese government is working up a regulatory intervention to bring down soaring energy prices. In addition to making the gas code mandatory, and potentially imposing price controls, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has acknowledged “an appetite in the Australian community” to strengthen the petroleum resource rent tax to ensure the budget nets a greater slice of the super profits of LNG producers. The new poll shows that in addition to a windfall tax, 62% of respondents would support a levy on fossil fuel producers to fund adaptation initiatives needed to avert global heating. A significant majority of respondents (80%) also want routine environmental assessments strengthened, so the climate impact of new fossil fuel developments would be considered in the regulatory process. Last week’s budget – and a new Treasury forecast that power prices would increase by 56% between now and the end of next year – has put energy front and centre in the national conversation. Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup Respondents to the Climate of the Nation survey have a range of views about what is driving the price spike. Most blame the privatisation of electricity generation and gouging by gas and electricity companies, but the survey shows close to a third of respondents think renewables are also part of the picture. A majority believed policy failure had contributed to the current price spike, with 64% of respondents thinking the market had failed to plan adequately for the transition away from fossil fuels. Older respondents were more likely to blame privatisation and profiteering for high prices, while younger people were more likely to blame policy failure by the Coalition during the decade-long climate wars. The poll has tracked attitudes to climate change for more than a decade. The latest survey suggests community concern about the issue persists at record levels, with 75% of respondents saying they are worried, which is the same result at 12 months ago. These results are the highest readings since the survey began, although 30% of respondents believe the seriousness of the climate crisis is exaggerated. More than half (52%) of survey respondents believe the Albanese government is not doing enough to prepare for the impact of climate change. The new poll shows women are more concerned about climate risks than men, and women are more inclined to support practical measures to reduce emissions, like government subsidies to reduce the cost of electric vehicles, and the phase-out of coal-fired power generation within 10 years. The Coalition voted against the Albanese government’s 2030 emissions reduction target of 43%, and said it wanted a debate about nuclear energy. The poll found 22% of respondents had an interest in Australia exploring nuclear, with men more likely than women to hold that view. But the poll also suggested nuclear supporters were less worried about the risks of runaway global heating than other survey respondents. Nuclear was also the preferred technology for the cohort of survey respondents who did not believe global heating was actually happening. The research suggested a majority of Australians would support concrete policy measures to electrify the transport, including the mandatory fuel efficiency standards, and a requirement that all new car sales in Australia be zero emissions vehicles by 2035. Australians would also support hosting a United Nations climate conference in Australia in collaboration with Pacific nations. A delegation of Australian ministers will front the Cop27 climate conference In Egypt later this month. Director of climate and energy for the Australia Institute, Richie Merzian, said the research showed Australians were “fed up with the mismanagement of the country’s natural resource wealth and want a windfall profits tax on the gas industry and a levy on our fossil fuel exports to help pay for climate related disasters”.\n",

      "Text: The French oil major TotalEnergies has sued the environmental group Greenpeace France and the climate consulting firm Factor-X over a report claiming that the company massively underestimated its 2019 greenhouse gas emissions, Total said on Wednesday. The civil complaint, served on 28 April, seeks a ruling that the November publication contains “false and misleading information”, a judicial order to withdraw the publication and cease all references to it under penalty of €2,000 (£1,760) a day in fines, plus a symbolic €1 in damages. A first procedural hearing will take place on 7 September at the Paris judicial court to set a calendar for arguments, though it will be several months before a judge begins to rule on the merits of the case. Greenpeace and Factor-X accused the oil major of having emitted about 1.64bn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2019 but only disclosing 455m tonnes in public statements. TotalEnergies countered that the report double-counted emissions by knowingly using dubious methodologies, which were morally prejudicial to the listed company. “This is a question of principle, and a judgment from the court will not prevent Greenpeace from continuing to criticise us and our climate strategy if they wish, but will remind them that public debate on issues with such high stakes concerning a listed company require rigour and good faith,” a TotalEnergies spokesperson said. The spokesperson said the company’s main goal was to have the court recognise the knowingly false nature of the report, since the Factor-X firm behind the maths presented itself as an expert in the field of carbon emissions accounting. Factor-X could not immediately be reached for comment. Greenpeace said the lawsuit was an attempt to muzzle it before the 26 May TotalEnergies general assembly, where activist shareholders will push for stricter climate commitments. Environmental groups have called for entry to be blocked in protest at the company’s global oil and gas projects. “TotalEnergies wants to drag Greenpeace through a long legal process … erase our reports and prevent us from denouncing their misleading and climate-killing practices,” said the Greenpeace France director, Jean-François Julliard. “We will continue to lift the veil on their responsibility in global warming.”\n",

      "Text: Energy markets and electricity systems are complicated beasts at the best of times, but throw in war, extreme weather, policy dysfunction and a pandemic and the picture gets even murkier. However, some of Australia’s conservative commentators seem to think there is one thing to blame for the country’s rising electricity prices and the threat of power outages: it’s all the fault of “net zero”. On Sky News, commentators warned of an “apocalypse” if the Albanese government pushed for net zero. “Families to pay double for electricity thanks to Net Zero,” said a headline in the Daily Telegraph last month, with a similar take in the Daily Mail. Both of the newspaper stories were based on analysis from rightwing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs (IPA). The analysis, which predicted family electricity bills would double by 2030, was based on an unrealistic assumption that six coal plants would close in Australia by 2030 but nothing else would come on line to replace them. This week the IPA has been on the front foot again, claiming the “energy crisis” was a direct result of policies to get to net zero. Separately, after the Albanese government formally submitted its improved 2030 emissions reduction target to the UN’s climate convention in June, Sky News commentator Andrew Bolt likened ministers to suicidal lemmings jumping off a cliff, and blamed climate policies for threats to electricity supply. Bolt’s decision to choose the analogy of lemmings is perhaps fitting, given this suicidal tendency is a myth. There’s no argument that electricity prices are going up, but does net zero have anything at all to do with it? The short and maybe even the long answer is no. “Our current energy prices are driven primarily by very high international fossil fuel prices,” says Prof Michael Brear, director of the Melbourne Energy Institute at the University of Melbourne. Because Australia’s gas and coal prices are linked to international markets and also influenced by rising oil prices, that has translated to increased costs. According to the latest bulletin on energy from the office of the chief economist, extreme weather, a global pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine pushed the cost of thermal coal to an average of US$280 ($413) a tonne for this year. For much of the past decade, prices have been well below $100 a tonne. It’s a similar story for the cost of liquefied natural gas, and oil prices also hit record highs in March. Net zero doesn’t get a mention. At the same time, some units at coal power plants in Australia have closed for maintenance or because of breakdowns, and this has also pushed prices up. Flooding around Australian coal mines has also created a fuel supply shortage. Brear says: “I don’t see renewable energy anywhere in that sequence of events playing a significant role in these high domestic energy prices.” While there has been a lot of talk about reaching net zero, Brear says there is still no legislated mandate. “How can we blame this [price crisis] on something that doesn’t yet exist? Many of us want to get to net zero by mid-century, but until it’s being driven in that direction by some mandate, I can’t see how one can blame anything on it.” Well before the current record fossil fuel prices and market volatility, Brear says, there was wide agreement that renewables were the least-cost option for decarbonisation. “If anything, over the last few months as fossil fuels have become more expensive, that case for decarbonisation primarily via renewables can only be enhanced.” When Anthony Albanese became prime minister in May, he promised to “end the climate wars” that have plagued Australia and brought turbulence to its energy policy for decades. Those climate wars were stoked and fed by partisan politics and the kind of unjustified scare stories that decarbonising would lead to economic disaster or the apocryphal $100 roasts. Like a self-fulfilling prophecy, what role has all that policy dysfunction had on the state of the country’s electricity market? Brear adds: “I think it’s reasonable to assume that if we had successive commonwealth and state governments all happy to work together to achieve secure, reliable and affordable power that decarbonised our economy, then we would have been better placed than we are today.” Alison Reeve, a climate change and energy expert at the Grattan Institute, says that even if there were legislated commitments in place to bring Australia’s emissions down to net zero by 2050, “it wouldn’t have mattered because it doesn’t change the economic recovery after Covid, or Russia’s war in Ukraine, or the fact our coal-fired power stations are old”. “If you’d had a clear decarbonisation signal in the electricity market, it would be easier for [generators and investors] to make decisions about maintenance. They would have a clear sense of when their exit date would be. “But we could have had the clearest, rolled-gold energy policy and that would not have stopped Russia invading Ukraine and our prices would still be linked to oil and gas.” Reeve says coal and gas prices started rising in late 2021 after a “Covid snapback where economies started demanding more energy”. The invasion of Ukraine saw economies that had been major buyers of Russian fuels look elsewhere, again pushing up demand and prices. But Reeve identifies another issue in Australia. She says that as coal units went offline, those that were still running had to go harder for longer, burning through more coal than anticipated. As this coal was priced under contract, when it ran out generators had to go into the market to buy more coal where the spot prices were higher. Reeve returned from Brussels last month after meeting energy experts and policy makers as a guest of the European parliament. Europe is also going through an energy crunch, and the UK has also seen electricity price rises, due mainly to the spiralling costs of gas. Reeve says European countries, including Germany, “have some short-term policy responses like filling gas storages and restarting some coal plants” to get them through the coming winter. Steps like this in Germany have been highlighted by some pro-coal figures to argue Australia should be embracing more coal, not less. But Reeve says those are short-term responses to cover immediate supply issues and don’t reflect the longer term. “Everything else they are doing is going faster on decarbonisation because that reduces their dependence on Russia for gas,” she says. To make the point, Germany’s finance minister Christian Lindner, of the centre-right Free Democratic Party, has taken to calling renewables “the energy of freedom”.\n",

      "Text: Britain’s endangered water voles will reach new heights when they are returned to Yorkshire’s Malham tarn for the first time in 50 years. Around 100 water voles will be reintroduced on Friday to the National Trust estate in the Yorkshire dales, home to England’s highest freshwater lake, in what the trust says is the highest-altitude reintroduction of the species it has carried out in Britain. Immortalised as Ratty in Kenneth Grahame’s The Wind in the Willows, the water vole is Britain’s fastest-declining mammal. The animal was once found in nearly every waterway in England, Scotland and Wales, but is now thought to have been lost in up to 90% of these sites, clinging on in isolated pockets, coastal marshes and backwaters. The intensification of agriculture, pollution and development, plus poor riverside management, has brought about the loss and degradation of the riverbank habitat in which the voles live. But the sharpest declines in the past 30 years have been caused by the spread of the American mink. These animals have established themselves on the waterways after escaping from fur farms, and they prey voraciously on the water vole. Reintroduction schemes, alongside programmes to control mink and manage habitats, are providing a lifeline for the species. Water voles have recently been returned to Cornwall after being declared extinct in the county, to the South Downs national park and to Gwent in south Wales. The Malham voles have been bred in captivity by a specialist agency and will be released over five days into the fen area of the tarn, which is unique for its flora, fauna and geology. A glacial lake set among ancient limestone pastures and upland hill farms, it is home to rare plants and animals including stonewort, sheltering pea mussels and the three-spined stickleback. The tarn also provides food for diving birds such as great crested grebes. At 377 metres above sea level, it is England’s highest freshwater lake, and this is the highest-altitude release undertaken by the National Trust. Previous upland releases have taken place at Duchray in the Scottish Highlands (up to 300m) and Brecon Beacons in Wales (154m). It is hoped the animals will recolonise the tarn and its surrounding streams, and play an important part in the ecosystem, grazing and burrowing into areas of the riverbank and allowing rare plants to grow, including mosses and liverworts that need patches of open habitat. The water voles will also act as a food source for predators such as barn owls and otters. Roisin Black, a National Trust ranger at Malham tarn, said: “In the rest of Europe, water voles are common. In Britain, the creatures are incredibly rare. We know water voles have thrived at Malham tarn in the past and, thanks to work by the National Trust, the habitat here is perfect for water voles again.” The animals will spend two days in large cages on the fringes of their new home. On the third day, the doors will be opened, with food placed on rafts in the water to encourage the voles to leave the cages and burrow in the banks. After five days, the cages will be removed altogether.  Rangers will monitor the health of the population, with a view to releasing a further 100 water voles in June next year. The reintroduction is part of a new land management approach agreed in 2015 for the 8,000 hectares of National Trust land in the Yorkshire dales. Farmers and partners will work with ecological processes to create a landscape that looks like the traditional dales but has a wider variety of natural habitats – moors, fields and woodlands – and better connections between them. Peter Welsh, ecologist for the National Trust in the Yorkshire dales, said: “Water voles once played an important part in the ecosystem at Malham tarn. Reintroducing them to the tarn is just one of the ways we are working alongside our farmers and other partners to restore wildlife and natural processes in the Yorkshire dales landscapes we care for.”\n",

      "Text: The biggest dairy companies in the world have the same combined greenhouse gas emissions as the UK, the sixth biggest economy in the world, according to a new report. The analysis shows the impact of the 13 firms on the climate crisis is growing, with an 11% increase in emissions in the two years after the 2015 Paris climate change agreement, largely due to consolidation in the sector. Scientific reports have shown that consumption of dairy, as well as meat, must be reduced significantly in rich nations to tackle the climate emergency. The report, by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) in the US, also says the growth of giant dairy companies has helped force milk prices below the cost of production for the last decade, causing a crisis in rural livelihoods and requiring taxpayer subsidies to keep farmers afloat. The researchers say caps on production should be reintroduced to protect both the climate and small farmers. “Unlike growing public scrutiny on fossil fuel companies, little public pressure exists to hold global meat and dairy corporations accountable for their emissions,” said Shefali Sharma, European director at IATP and report author. “Few of these companies are even reporting their emissions.” “As governments ratchet up their climate goals, the rise of large-scale dairy and public incentives that further increase corporate dairy power, production and emissions must be stopped,” she said. “Rural livelihoods and our planet’s future depend on it.” Dairy industry representatives said the report did not reflect the reality of the dairy sector. In a joint statement, Judith Bryans, president of the International Dairy Federation, and Donald Moore, executive director of the Global Dairy Platform, said: “The dairy sector is committed to producing nutritious foods in environmentally sound and responsible ways.” “It’s very easy to put out a report that criticises and tries to paint a simple picture of a sector which doesn’t contain all of the nuances or realities of how the global dairy sector nourishes the world with nutrient-rich, safe foods and does so in a manner that strives for continued environmental improvements while providing livelihoods to a large percentage of the world’s population,” said Bryans and Moore. A 2019 joint report by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Global Dairy Platform said: “In order to limit temperature rise, the dairy sector must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and work towards a low-carbon future … There is a clear case for immediate and more ambitious action.” It said: “The [dairy] sector’s emissions have increased by 18% between 2005 and 2015 because overall milk production has grown substantially by 30%. The good news is that there are many opportunities within the sector to limit climate change by reducing emissions. While there is some uncertainty about the size and timing of changes, it is certain that it is happening.” The report did not consider reducing production. Bryans and Moore said: “[Dairy’s] rich nutrition helps populations, particularly in developing nations, avoid malnutrition and poor health outcomes.” The biggest global producers of milk are the European Union, India and the US. The IATP report used the UN FAO’s global livestock environmental assessment model to assign emission levels to dairy produced in different regions. These were then applied to the companies’ production quantities as calculated by the IFCN dairy research network. More than 90% of the corporate dairy industries’ emissions are produced by the cows themselves, mostly in the form of methane. Research shows all plant-based milks, such as soya and oat, result in far fewer emissions than dairy milk. The IATP report found emissions from the big companies rose from 306m tonnes of CO2-equivalent in 2015 to 338m tonnes in 2017. The UK’s annual emissions are 350m tonnes a year. Consolidation in the dairy industry saw four out of five dairy farms close in the EU from 1981-2013, and 93% of family farms in dairy closing in the US since the 1970s. “You have to get bigger or get out,” said Sharma. “The key argument is this industry drives overproduction and low prices, which creates demand, and it has marketing power, which creates demand. Demand doesn’t just happen by accident.” “There is growing support for supply management, a crucial policy that could address dairy’s twin crises. It prevents overproduction, balances supply and demand and stabilises prices,” she said.\n",

      "Text: The UK may be in the grip of a winter lockdown but in one village on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales the local climate-change group has been busy. Plans are afoot to plant hundreds of trees on land surrounding Newton-le-Willows, in lower Wensleydale, in an effort to tackle the climate crisis. According to scientists, planting billions of trees across the world is one of the biggest and cheapest ways of taking CO2 out of the atmosphere. Bob Sampson, a former land-use planning adviser for the Ministry of Agriculture and member of the village’s climate-change group, has written to local landowners asking permission to grow trees on their land. Seven have agreed so far, and he is now recruiting villagers to sponsor, and plant, trees. The group is asking for £2 to cover the cost of a tree, a cane and a spiral to protect it from rabbits. They are yet to announce their plans in the village newsletter, but after a post on a WhatsApp group, which was started when the first lockdown was imposed in March last year, they’ve already had offers to sponsor more than 150 trees. “There’s been a positive response, much better than I was anticipating,” says Sampson. “We’ll be planting trees including oak, sycamore, birch and rowan, which will be tailored to relevant sites and will benefit both the climate and the environment in terms of landscape and wildlife.” This is not the only community gearing up to tackle the climate crisis during the pandemic. Since the first lockdown, there has been an increase in the number of people getting involved in projects aimed at improving local environments. The Woodland Trust, which runs a free trees scheme for schools and community groups, has seen this firsthand. Last year it sent out a total of just over one million trees. Despite Covid, it had more applications for spring 2021 trees than for the previous year and it is due to send out close to half a million saplings. In December the trust was seeing between 5,000 and 10,000 trees being applied for daily; the average is 4,000 a day. According to the Horticultural Trades Association, garden centre sales of hardy plants, shrubs and trees were up 50% from 13 May 2020 (when they reopened) to 31 January, compared with the same period the year before. Kay Clark, community development manager at the Royal Horticultural Society, has also seen a surge in interest since the pandemic began. “We’ve found there is an uplift of new community groups, people coming to do things for the first time. It’s amazing,” she says. Calls to its inquiry service have increased and the majority are entry-level queries, she adds. “I don’t think we’ve ever known anything like it. It’s been crazy.” The RHS is also inviting people to plant trees in memory of those who have lost their lives during the pandemic. Five hundred have been planted so far and the RHS has created a map online to keep track of where they are. In Somerset, the Food Forest Project helped to facilitate the creation of a two-acre food forest just before Christmas. There’s another one planned for November this year near one of the most deprived areas in the county. Since the start of the pandemic, the organisation has planted close to 2,000 trees across five sites. Tristan Faith, the founder, says: “Since March, there’s been a real shift towards self sufficiency and people thinking about what they can do. That has had a knock-on effect … and everyone wants to plant fruit trees.” He has also noticed an influx of people living in high-rise flats getting in touch about how they can get involved. Hundreds of miles north in Dumfries and Galloway Margaret Pool, chair of the Langholm Initiative, has also seen more interest in environmental activities and more volunteers. “We’ve been inundated with interest since the pandemic began. Our membership stands at 740. Volunteers are welcome.” The charity is about to begin work on a new nature reserve, including 200 hectares of native woodland, on Langholm Moor – after  raising £3.8m to purchase 5,000 acres of wildlife-rich and culturally important land from Buccleuch Estates. Will this trend continue? Clark at the RHS believes so. “It’s like an awakening,” she says. “Once people start to become community-minded or start to grow things, that’s not something that leaves you. It becomes part of your life.”\n",

      "Text: Humanity has made some uneven progress in reducing our addiction to fossil fuels – but there remain three areas of our lives in which we are notably not on track to kick the habit over the next 30 years, according to a new analysis. Record levels of investment in clean energy (solar has been called the cheapest source of electricity in history by the International Energy Agency) and a decline in coal-powered generation means less and less of the world’s power will come from fossil fuels between now and 2050, the analysis from Rhodium shows. Similarly, the blossoming electric vehicle market is going to drive down emissions from cars and trucks, with global oil consumption for on-road vehicles set to drop by 50% over the next three decades, the forecast finds. But even with these dramatic changes reshaping two of the world’s hungriest consumers of fossil fuels, emissions are still a long way from hitting net zero by 2050, as scientists say they must if dangerous global heating – spurring worsening heatwaves, floods, droughts and more – is to be avoided. A major reason for this is the stubborn, ongoing carbon pollution from three areas: aviation, shipping and industry. There is currently no widespread alternative to jet fuel or ship diesel, meaning steady or even rising fossil fuel use as developing countries’ economies grow. A range of industrial processes – such as cement-making and the production of plastic – will collectively fail to meaningfully cut carbon-intensive fuels by 2050, too. “We’ve made a lot of progress in the last few years – wind and solar are really poster children of success and electric vehicles are at a turning point now,” said Hannah Pitt, associate director at Rhodium, which made the projections based on anticipated policies until 2050. “That makes up a good chunk of emissions but there is much less progress in other sectors. With aviation and shipping, there’s just not as much innovation and no clear cost-effective alternatives to fossil fuels. “And then we have industrial processes that make up a huge fraction of emissions and each require their own tools and innovations to bring that down, and emissions are staying stubbornly high.” All told, global fossil fuel use will likely flatten or decline by mid-century before starting to grow again due to rising energy demand in various parts of the world, according to the report’s projections. Gas will lead the way, rising significantly in use even as oil and coal decline. Pitt said we are still a long way from breaking our dependence on fossil fuels in everything from switching on a light at home, to driving a car, to getting an Amazon package delivered, to flying to a holiday destination. “The success with renewables and EVs shows it can be done, but it really will take a lot of different policies and innovations. There’s no one solution,” said Pitt. “This is a good reminder that climate change touches every piece of our economies, and it needs solutions to each of those areas. There is a lot of work to do.”\n",

      "Text: Ministers must come forward with stringent new plans for low-carbon heating, as targets to insulate homes and generate more power from offshore wind are inadequate and sales of gas boilers showed a record rise last year, energy experts warned. At current rates, it will take 700 years for the UK to move to low-carbon heating, and at least 19,000 homes a week must be upgraded between now and 2050. There was a record rise last year of 1.8% in the number of new gas boilers installed, showing that the UK is going in the wrong direction. Government plans will see only about 12,500 homes in total installed with low-carbon heat pumps, according to a report from the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC). “We must move away from this situation where the government is sitting on its hands,” said Robert Gross, director of UKERC and co-author of the report. No new homes should be built with gas boilers, the experts said. The government’s pledge to build millions of new homes does not specify that they must be built with low-carbon heating. The prime minister pledged this week that offshore wind would power and heat every home by 2030, with 40GW of turbines. But those plans are geared towards existing levels of electricity usage, UKERC experts pointed out. Demand for electricity is set to double as drivers switch to electric cars and as we cease to heat our homes with fossil fuels. According to one estimate, heating the UK’s homes alone would require 67GW of offshore wind power. About £3bn will be given out in green home grants for insulation and other energy efficiency measures under plans unveiled as part of the Covid-19 economic rescue package in the summer. That will not be enough to make a significant change, however, and must be the start of a longer-term effort if targets are to be met, according to UKERC, which calculates that the heat and buildings sector will need £10bn of investment each year to meet the government’s target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Jan Rosenow of the University of Oxford, co-author of the report, said: “The problem is that [the £3bn] is one-off and that is not good enough – you have to have that level of funding, and more, for a sustained period of time to give the supply chain certainty, and get quality and availability in the long term.” He warned that previous policy U-turns had created uncertainty for suppliers, leaving installers of insulation and low-carbon systems in limbo and preventing the development of an adequate supply chain and industry in the UK. Senior figures in government, including the prime minister’s adviser, Dominic Cummings, are said to be enthusiastic about the prospects for hydrogen as a fuel, and ministers are expected to unveil a new hydrogen strategy as part of an energy white paper due later this year. Hydrogen boilers have been touted as an alternative to gas boilers that could use the existing gas distribution network. But it would be a mistake to put too much store by an unproven technology, UKERC warned. Drastic reductions in carbon dioxide from home heating are needed in this decade, and it is likely to take at least that long to conduct trials. “It is remarkable how this has emerged as a proposition,” said Gross. “Evidence of the feasibility of using hydrogen at a large scale needs to be improved.” Instead, ministers should focus on district heating schemes and “pump-priming” – subsidising in the short term to bring costs down – of low-carbon, air-source heat pumps. These pumps are barely used in the UK at present, and few installers have the skills needed as a result. But with investment, the costs could come down rapidly. Present policies have been “consumer-led”, relying on people installing insulation and making the switch to low-carbon heating themselves. This approach has clearly failed, UKERC said, and must be replaced with a mix of regulation and financial incentives. Gross said the wholesale change needed in the way Britons heat their homes was “not unprecedented”, as people changed from coal heating in the 1970s. A business department spokesperson said: “We are already taking comprehensive action to drive down emissions from heating on our path to net zero by 2050. Last week we launched the £2bn green homes grant, which will improve energy efficiency and support the installation of low-carbon heating in 600,000 homes, supporting 100,000 jobs while driving down emissions. “From 2025 all new homes will be required to have low-carbon heating as standard. We are exploring how to make the gas network cleaner through the green gas levy and have just announced plans for even more of our electricity to be provided by clean, green wind power.”\n",

      "Text: About 10 years ago I was called to give evidence before the Greater London assembly. I sat in a basement committee room with assembly members lined up behind a table and the public around us. The first question really surprised me; I was asked when we would have enough health evidence to justify action on air pollution. Even 10 years ago the number of scientific studies was overwhelming. A few years earlier, in 2007, St George’s, University of London, assembled a database that allowed them to compare 3,377 results from different studies. This just looked at impacts that could be seen over a few days rather than the harm that accrues over years. Perhaps the perception that we did not have enough evidence was due to a miscommunication from scientists. We tend to emphasise what we have yet to learn, rather than what we already know. Over the past decade, the list of air pollution and health studies has grown ever longer, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to issue new guidelines on the air that we breathe in 2021. A recent example of the volume of evidence on air pollution comes from last month’s report on the long-term exposure to air pollution from traffic by the US Health Effects Institute (HEI). This brought together the findings from 353 studies over nearly 40 years of research. Greatest confidence was attached to findings on early deaths and specifically those from heart disease and lung cancer as well as new cases of asthma in children and adults. Other findings included links to diabetes and low birthweight babies. Prof Michal Krzyzanowski, a former head of the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health who is now at Imperial College London, said: “While the goals set by WHO air quality guidelines relate to concentrations of certain air pollutants, the analysis like the one published by HEI point to the pollution sources which need to be addressed to protect health.” Traffic is not the only source of air pollution. Sources as diverse as solid fuel burning and farming all contribute but a study of 10 European cities found that 31% of the population lived within 75 metres of a busy road and 53% lived within 150 metres. A study by the Dutch research organisation CE Delft estimated traffic air pollution cost the EU about €64bn in 2016. It could be less than €14bn by 2030, depending on the policies governments choose. Clearly, scientists, politicians, and policymakers need to work more tightly together to translate air pollution evidence into air pollution action.\n",

      "Text: Hydrogen is unsuitable for use in home heating, and likely to remain so, despite the hopes of the UK government and plumbing industry, a comprehensive review of scientific papers has concluded. Hydrogen lobbyists are out in force at the Labour party conference this week, sponsoring several events in Liverpool, and will be plentiful at the Conservative party conference that begins this weekend. They are hoping to persuade the UK government to push ahead with a mooted large-scale rollout of hydrogen for home heating, as a replacement for the gas used to heat the vast majority of British homes. Hydrogen proponents say it would avoid households having to replace gas boilers with heat pumps, the other main contender for low-carbon home heating. But researchers reviewed 32 studies of hydrogen and concluded that it was unlikely to play a major role in home heating, either as a full replacement for fossil fuel gas heating, or as a blend with natural gas. Jan Rosenow, Europe director at the Regulatory Assistance Project, an energy thinktank, and co-author of the study, said there were too many technical difficulties to overcome to make hydrogen a viable and economic low-carbon heating fuel. “Using hydrogen for heating may sound attractive at first glance. However, all of the independent research on this topic comes to the same conclusion: heating with hydrogen is a lot less efficient and more expensive than alternatives such as heat pumps, district heating and solar thermal,” he said. The study, published on Tuesday in the peer-review scientific journal Joule, is the third major blow in the past week to proponents of hydrogen for home heating. Earlier this week, a separate study by the analyst company Cornwall Insight concluded that hydrogen would be close to twice as expensive for home heating as using gas alone. Last week, the Guardian revealed problems with a hydrogen pilot project in Scotland. Rosenow told the Guardian hydrogen was not the alternative to heat pumps that lobbyists were claiming. “For policymakers, hydrogen for heating appears attractive because it seems easy: just replace fossil gas with hydrogen with no impact on households. The reality is that significant technical alterations are needed including the pipework in homes and that it will cost people a lot of money to keep warm.” Michael Liebreich, the founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance and chairman of Liebreich Associates, said: “This is a timely paper, showing that no serious analysis has hydrogen playing more than a marginal role in the future of space heating. We need to get Europe’s heating systems off natural gas, and we need to do it without further delay. It’s time to stop the fight: the judges are unanimous and the winners are district heating, heat pumps and electrification.” There are many other uses for hydrogen as a fuel, for instance in decarbonising heavy industry and shipping. If these industries are to be genuinely low-carbon, the hydrogen used will need to be generated using renewable energy, rather than coming from fossil fuels as some hydrogen does at present. Some in the energy industry take a different view. James Earl, the director of gas at the UK’s Energy Networks Association, who represents the UK’s energy operators, told the Guardian: “No one heating system will get us to the UK’s net zero goals as a one-size-fits all approach to decarbonising heating will not work across the UK’s diverse customer base. We need to look at hydrogen, electrification and other technologies all as part of the mix.” He added: “While hydrogen is expensive today, it is falling in cost rapidly and is forecast to fall to a similar cost to natural gas by 2030, if the cost of carbon emissions is fully recognised. Customers need choice and access to a range of technologies including heat pumps, hydrogen boilers, district heating and hybrid heating systems if we are to deliver a sustainable energy system for the future.”\n",

      "Text: The statistic is startling. In the past two years, the global economy has grown by 6.5 percent, but carbon dioxide emissions from energy generation and transport have not grown at all, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported last month. CO2 emissions in Europe, the United States, and — most stunningly — China have been falling. What is going on? These numbers raise a key question of huge importance if nations are to avoid the worst effects of climate change: Is the world on a path toward “decoupling” economic activity from carbon dioxide emissions? Put another way: Is the idea of a future of “green growth,” with prosperity rising and emissions falling, real? Or as some fear, is it a dangerous myth? When the United Nations holds an official signing ceremony for the Paris climate agreement on April 22, the hope is this high-profile event will ensure political momentum for meeting the Paris pledge to halt global warming at “well below” two degrees Celsius. But even climate scientists elated by the Paris agreement agree that, even with political will, the task will be extremely tough. Many are unsure whether to be optimists, keen to show the job can be done, or pessimists, determined to ensure nobody thinks it will be easy. In its analysis last month, the IEA, a body linked with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), reported that global CO2 emissions from energy-related activities have not risen since 2013, staying at 32.1 billion tons even as the global economy grew. This surprising “decoupling” of emissions from economic activity was led by the two largest emitters, China and the U.S., which both registered declines in emissions of about 1.5 percent. The IEA finding followed a similar conclusion about global emissions from an international team of climate scientists, headed by Corinne le Quere of the University of East Anglia in England, reported during the Paris climate conference last December. A good part of the decoupling, both studies agree, is attributable to China. Its turnaround has been “quite remarkable,” says Fergus Green, an analyst of China’s energy policy at the London School of Economics. The country’s coal use grew annually by more than 8 percent between 2000 and 2013, and that growth was the biggest single cause of rising global CO2 emissions. As recently as 2011, China got 80 percent of its electricity from coal. But growing concern about killer smogs has triggered new controls that mean many coal-burning power plants in China have now been mothballed. Coal burning fell by 3 percent in 2015, by which time the percentage of China’s electricity produced by coal had fallen to 70 percent, according to the IEA. Chinese emissions from oil and gas burning continue to grow, Green says. But that is more than counterbalanced by a combination of declining use of coal and reductions in energy demand from structural changes in the Chinese economy, with energy-guzzling heavy industries like cement and steel production both now declining. Per head of population, Chinese emissions exceed those of Europe, even though average income is less than a half that of citizens of the European Union. But China seems set on the road to climate redemption. In Paris, Beijing pledged to peak emissions by 2030. In fact, it may already have done so, says Green. And even if not, he foresees only small increases from now on. China is following a road already taken by more economically developed nations. The carbon intensity of high-income OECD countries has more than halved since 1970, meaning half as much CO2 is now emitted for every dollar of GDP. Lately, things have gone further. U.S. emissions have been falling for more than half a decade now, as coal burning is replaced by fracked natural gas and wind power. The United States has become 28 percent richer, but 6 percent cleaner since 2000, says Nate Aden of the World Resources Institute, who reported that, since 2000, 21 countries — all in Europe, except the U.S. and Uzbekistan — have reduced their carbon emissions while growing GDP. Britain, for instance, grew its economy by 27 percent while cutting emissions by 20 percent between 2000 and 2014. Part of this national decoupling is a result of advanced economies offshoring heavy industry to places like China, says Aden, with most of the “decouplers” having reduced the industrial share of their economic activity. But this is a minor element, he believes. These 21 nations show an average emissions reduction of 15 percent, but cuts in the industrial share of GDP are just 3 percent. That said, clearly not all countries are decoupling. Emissions continue to rise in much of Asia and the Middle East. From Turkey to India, enthusiasm for coal remains strong. India has plans to double its already large coal production, which the Delhi government justifies by pointing out that its per-capita emissions remain only one-tenth of those of the U.S. But optimists note that, despite the bluster, India also has big plans for expanding solar energy production. It is far from clear, says the University of East Anglia’s le Quere, that the world has yet reached peak emissions of CO2 from energy sources — still less that this translates into a peak in greenhouse gas emissions overall. But with the three largest emitters — China, the U.S., and the European Union — all showing evidence of decoupling, the signs are suddenly rather encouraging. The first hint that decoupling was under way came four years ago, when a report from the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency and the European Commission’s Joint Research Center (JRC) found that in 2012,CO2 emissions rose just 1.1 percent globally, while GDP rose 3.5 percent. Greet Janssens-Maenhout of the JRC says now: “There has been continuous and increasing decoupling over the past four years.” There is no modern precedent. Global CO2 emissions growth briefly faltered in the early 1980s, in 1992, and again in 2009; but in each case this was due to a decline in economic activity. The biggest cause of decoupling is the dramatic growth of renewable energy. Last year, more than twice as much money was put into new capacity for renewables such as solar and wind power than into new power stations burning fossil fuels, according to a new analysis by the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management. For the first time, the majority of this investment was in developing countries, with China responsible for 36 percent of the total. The reason has as much to do with price as climate policies. The cost of photovoltaic equipment, much of it manufactured in China, has fallen by 80 percent in the past decade. As a result, auctions for solar power in Texashave recently seen prices as low as 4 cents per kilowatt hour, which is below the price of most coal-generated energy. Renewables still only deliver about 10 percent of the total electricity generated worldwide. Even so, Ulf Moslener, a coauthor of the Frankfurt report, said recent investment in green energy has cut annual CO2 emissions from all energy sources, including transport, by about 1.5 billion tons, or 5 percent, from where they would otherwise be. The growth of renewables is being accompanied by a sharp decline in coal burning, not only in China, but in the U.S. and elsewhere. Canadian climate blogger Kyla Mandel recently noted that a quarter of European Union countries no longer burn any coal for power generation. This process is being amplified by a flight of capital, as investors fear that expensive coal mines and coal-burning power plants may become “stranded assets,” with no markets, as renewables ramp up and limits on CO2 emissions begin to bite. The coal industry has been hit hard, with the largest U.S. coal company, Peabody Energy, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection just this week. This concern is likely to spread to other fossil fuels, says British energy analyst and former Greenpeace science director Jeremy Leggett. Current low oil prices may encourage oil burning and could postpone the market penetration of, for instance, electric cars. But low prices also discourage investment in new oil fields. As Leggett put it in a recent blog: “Most fossil fuel companies face a future in which they might not have the capital to expand even if they still want to.” But there are countervailing trends. The IEA’s emissions audit does not cover all CO2 emissions. Deforestation for the past half century has been a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, although that too now appears to be declining. More worrying — because they are still increasing fast but were left out of the Paris agreement — are emissions from international aviation and shipping. Expansion plans for the aviation industry could lead to emissions from this source tripling by 2040, says Annie Petsonk of the Environmental Defense Fund. Once these are taken into account, “the decoupling claimed for many nations disappears altogether,” says Kevin Anderson of the University of Manchester in England. The aviation industry may reach agreement later this year on plans to offset its emissions by investing in United Nations schemes for forest conservation. But some environmentalists are concerned that the industry will simply be funding projects already promised by governments as part of their plans to meet their Paris pledges. If so, there will be no additional benefit to the planet. There are growing concerns too about trends for some other greenhouse gases — in particular, the second most-important man-made planet warmer, methane, the main constituent of natural gas. When burned, natural gas produces energy with fewer CO2 emissions than coal. But if distribution systems leak significant amounts of gas, the warming effect of that methane could negate the benefit of switching off coal. “Methane numbers may undermine the basic thesis [of decoupling],” says climate activist Bill McKibben, who recently wrote in The Nation that U.S. emissions of methane — “CO2’s nasty little brother” — have increased by more than 30 percent. In the article, McKibben pinpointed leakage from fracking as the likely cause. This is a damaging failure of regulation, but at least it is fixable, at relatively low cost, according to studies by the United Nations Environment Programme. And while methane is a potent greenhouse gas, its lifetime in the atmosphere is roughly a decade, so we won’t be living with the consequences for nearly as long as those from CO2 emissions. Even if global emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases can be curbed, however, this won’t fix climate change, say critics of the decoupling narrative. The big problem is that warming is driven not by annual emissions but by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And while methane may disappear relatively quickly, CO2 hangs around for centuries. Last year, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million (ppm) for the first time. According to the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, keeping global warming below two degrees probably requires keeping this figure below about 450 ppm. That means emitting in total no more than about 800 billion tons of CO2 from all sources — or less than 20 years worth at current rates. In practice, emissions have to be brought down to zero by mid-century. “Set against the small and rapidly dwindling carbon [emissions] budgets associated with the Paris Agreement… the tentative signs of decoupling are of little relevance,” says Anderson, of Manchester University, an avowed pessimist. “The concept of green growth is very misleading.” Others are more optimistic. Even if decoupling cannot limit warming to two degrees, it could deliver three or four degrees, after which the world might find ways to draw down CO2 from the atmosphere. But all agree the bottom line is that, as le Quere puts it, “we need to bring emissions down to zero. The faster we decrease the emissions, the less risk we take.” Decoupling is real, but it is just the start.\n",

      "Text: Parliament’s pension fund has made record investments in renewable energy and cut its exposure to fossil fuel companies to bring MPs’ pensions in line with the government’s climate action targets. A report from the £700m pension fund showed that almost a third is now being invested in low carbon and environmentally sustainable funds following calls from hundreds of MPs to align the fund with the government’s legally binding climate commitments. The decision by the pension fund’s trustees to back a push for greener investment, first revealed by the Guardian last year, has resulted in renewable energy infrastructure investments making up 5% of the fund for the first time. The move is a victory for the 360 serving and former MPs who have been pushing for the pension fund’s investments to fall in line with the government’s climate agenda. The campaign was supported by all of the Labour party’s leadership candidates, the leaders of the Liberal Democrats and the SNP, and senior Conservatives including Guy Opperman, the minister for pensions and financial inclusion. However, the pension’s trustees have stopped short of divesting entirely from fossil fuel companies and retain multimillion-pound investments in the oil companies Royal Dutch Shell and BP. The annual report showed that the fund has decreased its investment in BP by almost two-thirds in the past year, to £4.4m, and cut its holdings in Shell by a quarter, to £8m. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP behind the campaign, said the fund needs to fall in line with parliament’s decision last year to declare a climate emergency by divesting from all fossil fuels. “Investing in clean energy is clearly the right thing to do, financially and for the future of our planet, so I’m glad the Parliamentary Pension Fund is doing this. But it has to also stop investing in Shell and BP,” she said. “These investments cannot be justified on ethical, environmental or financial grounds, and they undermine MPs’ credibility in addressing the climate emergency. They have to stop.” The trustees wrote to Lucas last year, in correspondence seen by the Guardian, to confirm that the fund would reconsider its investment strategy but adding that it may choose to remain investors in oil companies in order to have a “voice” at investor meetings and shareholder votes.\n",

      "Text: The era of leaded petrol is officially over, the UN has announced, eliminating a major threat to human and planetary health. UN experts have called the use of the fuel, which began in 1922, a “catastrophe for the environment and public health”. By the 1970s, nearly all petrol produced around the world contained lead. Now the last country to use it, Algeria, has finally stopped selling it in petrol stations. Officials claim the end of the use of leaded petrol will prevent more than 1.2 million premature deaths a year. This is part of a wider push to improve air pollution levels across the world. Lead is extremely poisonous and there is no safe level of exposure. The fuel has contaminated air, dust, soil, drinking water and food crops for the better part of a century, causing heart disease, stroke and cancer. It is of particular concern for children, as it damages their developing brains and ability to learn. “The successful enforcement of the ban on leaded petrol is a huge milestone for global health and our environment,” said Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN environment programme. “Overcoming a century of deaths and illnesses that affected hundreds of millions and degraded the environment worldwide, we are invigorated to change humanity’s trajectory for the better through an accelerated transition to clean vehicles and electric mobility.” The effects of the last use of this fuel will likely linger for decades. A recent study found that the substance, banned in London 20 years ago, still has an impact on air quality in the capital. While levels in the city are much lower than at their peak in the 1980s, they remain far above natural background levels. Lead was added to fuels in the UK from the 1930s and phased out in the decade up to 1999. The metal from the emissions was found to be deposited on urban surfaces and soils over many decades and winds stir the particles, throwing them back up into the air. It can also be disturbed by traffic and building works. By the 1980s, most high-income countries had prohibited the use of leaded petrol, yet as late as 2002, almost all low- and middle-income countries were still using the fuel. A 19-year campaign by the UN has pushed for other countries to follow suit, and Algeria was the last to stop providing the petrol this July. Now, the sale and use of this fuel has ended globally. Poisonous lead is still used in paints, batteries, and in household items. The next push from the UN will be to phase out fossil fuels in cars, and mandate the use of cleaner fuel. They warn that while many countries have already begun transitioning to electric cars, 1.2bn new vehicles will hit the road in the coming decades, and many of these will use fossil fuels, especially in developing countries, pointing out that poor-quality used vehicles from Europe, the United States and Japan, are likely to be imported to mid- and low-income countries once richer communities transition to electric. Andersen explained: “We urge these same stakeholders to take inspiration from this enormous achievement to ensure that now that we have cleaner fuels, we also adopt cleaner vehicles standards globally – the combination of cleaner fuels and vehicles can reduce emissions by more than 80%.”\n",

      "Text: The number of jobs in renewable energy in the UK has plunged by nearly a third in recent years, and the amount of new green generating capacity by a similar amount, causing havoc among companies in the sector, a new report has found. Prospect, the union which covers much of the sector, has found a 30% drop in renewable energy jobs between 2014 and 2017, as government cuts to incentives and support schemes started to bite. It also found investment in renewables in the UK more than halved between 2015 and 2017. The union compared the situation to the devastation caused to coalmining communities in the 1980s and demanded instead a “just transition” to clean energy. The Prospect report analysed and collated data taken from various sources, including the government, surveys and industry. Sue Ferns, the senior deputy secretary general at Prospect, told the Guardian: “The government’s market-led approach has failed, and resulted on offshoring green jobs while UK workers are left behind. Without a proper industrial strategy from government that promotes low-carbon generation like renewables and new nuclear, we will be unable to secure the future of our energy supply, which is under threat in the coming decade.” The focus on Brexit had not helped, she added. “The government’s tunnel vision on Brexit means the real challenges facing our country have been neglected for too long. We need a sensible deliverable strategy that provides a stable long-term pathway to decarbonisation.” The drastic fall in jobs came as the government effectively shut down schemes that rewarded consumers for buying solar panels, withdrew subsidies for onshore wind and reduced incentives for low-carbon energy. Ministers have argued that as the costs of renewable energy have fallen sharply in recent years, the industries should no longer rely on public subsidy, but multiple redrawings of government schemes in recent years have helped to create turmoil and a lack of certainty for companies. Government support has taken the form of various schemes across the last decade, including feed-in tariffs for consumers with solar panels, a renewables obligation forcing the big energy suppliers to invest in renewables, and most recently, contracts for difference. The latter were meant to overhaul the whole energy sector by setting up auctions by which companies would bid for generation contracts favouring low-carbon energy, but early troubles meant dirty energy such as diesel generators were often the inadvertent winners, and while the scheme still operates it has enjoyed little support from successive chancellors. Between 2016 and 2017, there was a sharp fall in investment in UK renewables, which fell 56% to the lowest level since 2008, according to the as-yet-unpublished Prospect report that has been seen by the Guardian. Last year, the annual rate of addition of renewables capacity fell to its lowest level since 2012, which the union said was driven by the collapse in solar and onshore wind deployment. Without the significant rise in bioenergy capacity that took place in 2018, the fall in new renewables would have been much greater, the union said. While some sectors have remained buoyant, such as offshore wind, new capacity in onshore wind in England slowed markedly after the government withdrew financial support and changed planning laws to make the construction of windfarms more difficult. Luke Clark, head of external affairs at the trade body RenewableUK, said: “We’re expecting the number of direct jobs in offshore wind to treble to 27,000 by 2030, as part of the landmark offshore wind sector deal we’ve agreed with government, as this provides long-term certainty for the industry. However, as onshore wind remains excluded from government-backed auctions for contracts to generate power, the UK is missing out on employment and investment opportunities offered by this technology. The auction process has also failed to bring forward new technologies like tidal energy projects, so there is huge potential to ramp up employment in renewables as we move to net zero emissions.” The trade union said the dismal picture for jobs in much of the sector contrasted with government rhetoric on issues such as moving to a net zero carbon target and parliament declaring a climate emergency. Ferns told the Guardian: “Successive governments have promised us a green jobs revolution, but after an initial upsurge we have now started going backwards. This is deeply worrying for the future of the energy sector and for low-carbon jobs in the UK.” She added: “The Committee on Climate Change has recommended zero carbon by 2050 and others are pushing for even more ambitious timescales. We need a just transition for all the workers affected and this means we need to work proactively to ensure that the damage inflicted on coal communities in the 1980s is not repeated.” A spokesperson for BEIS told the Guardian: “We’ve seen the number of green collar jobs soar to approximately 400,000, with clean growth at the heart of this government’s modern industrial strategy. This figure could more than quadrupled to 2m by 2030. We’ve injected £2.5bn into low-carbon innovation and [the] deal with the offshore wind industry will see up to £40bn infrastructure investment.” Green collar jobs are defined by BEIS as those in clean growth, which means activity that increases the national income while reducing emissions. The number of people working in green jobs in the UK was estimated at 1m in 2012, by the UN.\n",

      "Text: In Minnesota, an administrative hearing resulted in a judicial recommendation that will have impacts across the country. It was a case argued mainly between environmental groups (such as Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, and their clients Fresh Energy and the Sierra Club) and energy producers (such as the now-bankrupt coal company Peabody Energy) regarding what a reasonable social cost of carbon should be. I was called as an expert witness in the case along with respected climate scientist Dr. Andrew Dessler. We were opposed by the well-known contrarians Drs. Roy Spencer, Richard Lindzen, and William Happer (who has recently received attention related to his charged fees in the case). In full disclosure, Dr. Dessler and I were not paid for our work in the case. I recently wrote about the testimony and provided links to the testimonies submitted for the case. The judge’s recommendations and how they will impact energy decisions in the USA were the keys to this trial. On April 15th, the Administrative Law Judge decided that the estimated cost of carbon pollution currently used in Minnesota is too low. New knowledge about how fast the climate is changing, how much it will change, and how it will affect societies and economies would be reflected in a larger carbon cost. This leads to a large increase in the estimated cost, from $0.44-4.53 per ton to $11-57 per ton. A summary of the ruling can be found here and the full report is available here. How was this case won? Well certainly it helps to have science on your side. Without that, even the most expensive expert witnesses struggle. But Peabody’s scientists made errors that were easy to identify and point out to the Judge. Furthermore, the Judge was smart, quickly able to see through nonsense non-science. For those of you that read the report, you’ll notice that the Peabody side made claims about the natural variability of Earth’s climate, about Earth temperature changes, and about extreme weather events. The environmental group’s side rebutted these viewpoints (see pages 15-19).  We also showed that the experts for Peabody relied extensively on non-peer-reviewed reports, blog sites, and think tanks to support their conclusions (paragraph 359 in the report). The peer-reviewed scientific literature is the best source for accurate climate science information. In other areas, the Peabody experts used scientific papers that we showed were incorrect (paragraph 360 in the report, for example). Perhaps the key findings are best articulated in the judicial conclusions, which begin on page 114. Among the conclusions are: I hope that this case will serve as a standard for other utility commissions as they work through the complex issues of the cost of carbon pollution. I also hope that the high standards of science used in Minnesota will be reflected in other areas where similar cases arise. You can’t just bring in some contrarian scientists to make unsupported statements that minimize the costs of climate change. You have to bring in the best scientists and base your conclusions on high-quality peer reviewed studies.\n",

      "Text: The World Bank is making a major push to develop large-scale hydropower, something it had all but abandoned a decade ago but now sees as crucial to resolving the tension between economic development and the drive to tame carbon use. Major hydropower projects in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia, Nepal and elsewhere – all of a scale dubbed \"transformational\" to the regions involved – are part of the bank's fundraising drive among wealthy nations. Bank lending for hydropower has scaled up in recent years, and officials expect the trend to continue. Such projects were shunned in the 1990s, in part because they can be disruptive to communities and ecosystems. But the World Bank is opening the taps for dams and related infrastructure as its president, Jim Yong Kim, tries to resolve a quandary at the bank's core: how to eliminate poverty while adding as little as possible to carbon emissions. \"Large hydro is a very big part of the solution for Africa and south Asia and south-east Asia ... I fundamentally believe we have to be involved,\" said Rachel Kyte, the bank's vice-president for sustainable development and an influential voice among Kim's top staff members. The earlier move out of hydro \"was the wrong message ... That was then. This is now. We are back.\" It is a controversial stance. The bank backed out of large-scale hydropower because of the steep trade-offs involved. Big dams produce lots of cheap, clean electricity, but they often uproot villages and destroy the livelihoods of the people the institution is supposed to help. A 2009 World Bank review of hydropower noted the \"overwhelming environmental and social risks\" that had to be addressed but also concluded that Africa and Asia's vast and largely undeveloped hydropower potential was key to providing dependable electricity to the hundreds of millions of people who remain without it. \"What's the one issue that's holding back development in the poorest countries? It's energy. There's just no question,\" Kim said in an interview. Advocacy groups remain sceptical, arguing that large projects, such as Congo's long-debated network of dams around Inga Falls, may be of more benefit to mining companies or industries in neighbouring countries than poor communities. \"It is the old idea of a silver bullet that can modernise whole economies,\" said Peter Bosshard, policy director of International Rivers, a group that has organised opposition to the bank's evolving hydro policy and argued for smaller projects designed around communities rather than mega-dams meant to export power throughout a region. \"Turning back to hydro is being anything but a progressive climate bank,\" said Justin Guay, a Sierra Club spokesman on climate and energy issues. \"There needs to be a clear shift from large, centralised projects.\" The major nations that support the World Bank, however, have been pushing it to identify such projects – complex undertakings that might happen only if an international organisation is involved in sorting out the financing, overseeing the performance and navigating the politics. The move toward big hydro comes amid Kim's stark warning that global warming will leave the next generation with an \"unrecognisable planet\". That dire prediction, however, has left him struggling for how best to respond and frustrated by some of the bank's inherent limitations. In his speeches, Kim talks passionately about the bank's ability to \"catalyse\" and \"leverage\" the world to action by mobilising money and ideas, and he says he is hunting for ideas \"equal to the challenge\" of curbing carbon use. He has criticised the \"small bore\" thinking he says has hobbled progress on the issue. However, the bank remains in the business of financing traditional fossil-fuel plants, including those that use the dirtiest form of coal, as well as cleaner but carbon-based natural gas infrastructures. Among the projects likely to cross Kim's desk in coming months, for example, is a 600-MW power plant in Kosovo that would be fired by lignite coal, the bottom of the barrel when it comes to carbon emissions. The plant has strong backing from the United States, the World Bank's major shareholder. It also meshes with one of the bank's other long-standing imperatives: give countries what they ask for. The institution has 188 members to keep happy and can go only so far in trying to impose its judgment over that of local officials. Kim, who in his younger days demonstrated against World Bank-enforced \"orthodoxy\" in economic policy, now may be hard-pressed to enforce an energy orthodoxy of his own. Kosovo's domestic supplies of lignite are ample enough to free the country from imported fuel. Kim said there is little question Kosovo needs more electricity, and the new plant will allow an older, more polluting facility to be shut down. \"I would just love to never sign a coal project,\" Kim said. \"We understand it is much, much dirtier, but ... we have 188 members ... We have to be fair in balancing the needs of poor countries ... with this other bigger goal of tackling climate change.\" The bank is working on other ideas. Kim said he is considering how the bank might get involved in creating a more effective world market for carbon, allowing countries that invest in renewable energy or \"climate friendly\" agriculture to be paid for their carbon savings by industries that need to use fossil fuels. Existing carbon markets have been plagued with volatile pricing – Europe's cost of carbon has basically collapsed – or rules that prevent carbon trading with developing countries. \"We've got to figure out a way to establish a stable price of carbon,\" Kim said. \"Everybody knows that.\" He has also staked hope for climate progress on developments in agriculture. Hydropower projects, however, seem notably inside what Kim says is the bank's sweet spot – complex, high-impact, green and requiring the sort of joint public and private financing Kim says the bank can attract. The massive hydropower potential of the Congo river, estimated at about 40,000MW, is such a target. Its development is on a list of top world infrastructure priorities prepared by the World Bank and other development agencies for the Group of 20 major economic powers. Two smaller dams on the river have been plagued by poor performance and are being rehabilitated with World Bank assistance. A third being planned would represent a quantum jump – a 4,800MW, $12bn giant that would move an entire region off carbon-based electricity. The  African Development Bank has begun negotiations over the financing, and the World Bank is ready to step in with tens of millions of dollars in technical-planning help. \"In an ideal world, we start building in 2016. By 2020, we switch on the lights,\" said Hela Cheikhrouhou, energy and environment director for the African Development Bank. It is the sort of project that the World Bank had stayed away from for many years – not least because of instability in the country. But as the country tries to move beyond its civil war and the region intensifies its quest for the power to fuel economic growth, the bank seems ready to move. Kim will visit Congo this month for a discussion about development in fragile and war-torn states. Kyte, the World Bank vice president, said the Inga project will be high on the agenda. \"People have been looking at the Inga dam for as long as I have been in the development business,\" she said. \"The question is: Did the stars align? Did you have a government in place? Did people want to do it? Are there investors interested? Do you have the ability to do the technical work? The stars are aligned now. Let's go.\" This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from the Washington Post\n",

      "Text: Meeting legal limits for air pollution can seem impossibly difficult but understanding the links between our environmental problems, and tackling them together, can simplify attempts to find solutions. For example, our polluted roads and rivers are connected by runoff from street drains, and the road traffic that pollutes our air also produces noise that disturbs our peace. Tyre fragments and the plastic litter ground up by traffic on our streets ends up in our air and oceans. Investing in local shops and services can help us swap motorised traffic for walking and cycling, improve neighbourhoods, help the climate crisis and air pollution, as well as improve our health through daily exercise. As for net zero, diesel cars and wood burning have been serious mistakes for air pollution and are not helping our climate. Speaking to the Conservative Environment Network in December, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs minister Jo Churchill called for cross-government and cross-society action to tackle air pollution. While initiatives such as the UK Clean Air Programme try to bridge research boundaries, it is difficult for researchers, civil servants and local government to join together our environmental problems without a strategic framework. It is 10 years since the abolition of the independent royal commission on environmental pollution. Set up in 1970, it had a wide remit to investigate national and international pollution issues and to warn of future dangers. Its reports were heavily solutions-based and had direct impact on government policy. The commission’s 1983 report on lead in petrol was immediately followed by changes in UK law, as was its 1989 report on genetically modified organisms. The commission’s recommendation for a long-term CO2 reduction target was accepted by government in 2000 and the EU-wide environmental regulation of polluting industries and waste stems from its recommendations. Noel Nelson, part of the civil service team that worked with the commission, said: “Although members were all experts in their own fields, the best solutions were seldom found in any one discipline.” Today, the absence of an independent, strategic view of environmental evidence leaves us vulnerable to missed opportunities. Do we need a new royal commission? Prof Sir Stephen Holgate, a former commission member, said: “Since the dissolution of the commission in 2011, the number and complexity of environmental challenges in our changing world has greatly increased. Examples include: the transition to zero carbon, changing environment and zoonotic infectious disease, addressing water pollution, citizen science to monitor and improve the environment and how to harness and work with the environment to improve health and wellbeing. These require imaginative analysis leading to multiple solutions-based outcomes.”\n",

      "Text: A key group of leading G20 nations is committed to climate targets that would lead to disastrous global warming, scientists have warned. They say China, Russia, Brazil and Australia all have energy policies associated with 5C rises in atmospheric temperatures, a heating hike that would bring devastation to much of the planet. The analysis, by the peer-reviewed group Paris Equity Check, raises serious worries about the prospects of key climate agreements being achieved at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow in three months. The conference – rated as one of the most important climate summits ever staged – will attempt to hammer out policies to hold global heating to 1.5C by agreeing on a global policy for ending net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050. The EU and UK have outlined emission pledges that could bring the world close to these aspirations. However, those of China, Russia, Brazil and Australia – which remain reliant on continued fossil-fuel burning – would trigger temperature rises of 5C if followed by the rest of the world. This dramatic discrepancy reveals a deep division over the energy and environment policies of the world’s richest nations. “Without more ambition from China, Brazil, Russia and Australia, Cop26 will fail to deliver the future our planet needs,” warned Tanya Steele, chief executive at WWF. The stark difference between the climate plans of different G20 nations – who together are responsible for 85% of all global carbon emissions – was underlined last week in Naples, when a meeting of member states’ energy and environment ministers ended with the group failing to agree on a package of commitments to tackle climate change. “The G20 is failing to deliver,” said the online activist network Avaaz. The G20 meeting had been viewed as a critically important staging post leading up to Cop26 and its failure to find common ground underlines the crucial differences that divide nations in the group and indicate it is not going to be easy to secure a meaningful accord in Scotland. This point was backed by Yann Robiou du Pont, the lead researcher for the Paris Equity Tracker analysis. “The research underlines what many of us fear: major economies are simply not doing enough to tackle the climate crisis and, in many cases, G20 countries are leaving us on track [for] a world of more heatwaves, flooding and extreme weather events.” A world that would be 5C hotter than it was before the Industrial Revolution, when fossil-fuel burning began in earnest, would be one in which a quarter of the global population would face extreme drought for at least one month a year; rainforests would be destroyed; and melting ice sheets would result in dangerous sea-level rises. In addition, loss of reflective ice from the poles could cause oceans to absorb more solar radiation, while melting permafrost in Siberia and other regions would release plumes of methane, another pernicious greenhouse gas. Inevitably, temperatures would soar even further. By contrast, scientists say that if temperature rises can be kept below 1.5C, then the worst impacts of climate change could be prevented – though they also point out that temperatures have already risen 1.2C, leaving the world facing very tight margins to avoid the worst impacts of global warming over the next 30 years. The extent of the climate crisis has also been highlighted this month with extreme weather events causing devastation across the world: deadly floods have swept through Germany, Belgium and China, while massive wildfires have gripped the US and Siberia. Global warming has been implicated in every case. “Ahead of Cop26, we now need to see action and we owe it to the most vulnerable countries to rally together. Failure to deliver on our commitments is not an option and we must not be found wanting,” said Alok Sharma, the former UK business secretary who is now president of Cop26. Sharma last week was strongly critical of countries such as “big emitters” Russia and China who must do more to tackle climate change, he warned. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nearly 200 countries committed to submit new climate plans every five years with a goal to limit global warming to well below 2C, aiming at 1.5C, compared to pre-industrial levels. However, earlier this year, the United Nations issued a “red alert” over current climate plans, warning they were “nowhere close” to meeting the Paris goals. The International Energy Agency recently said that if the world was to stay within 1.5C of warming, all further development and exploration of new fossil fuel sources should cease from this year. President Joe Biden’s climate envoy, John Kerry, told the Observer that the US was carefully considering the implications of the IEA report. “I know that people are very heavily aware of the need to shift our programmes and policy [in a way that] really robustly embraces that,” he said. “Everybody in the world need to be working on this. We need to think differently. We should be pushing hard in a different direction [from fossil fuels].” He said Biden was also working to ensure the US and China were aligned on the need to stay within 1.5C. “The first thing [Biden] hopes about China is that China recognises the reality of where we all are, and where China is, and what we need to do to get this job done. China is a global leader with a special responsibility to make sure we are all meeting [climate goals]. We want to find common ground.” He said there were no plans for a US-China summit, such as President Barack Obama conducted with China’s President Xi Jinping ahead of the Paris conference, but said such a meeting was “not out of the question”. He added: “A lot of conversations with China have not yet arrived at agreement.”\n",

      "Text: A proposed new £600m solar farm in eastern England – covering an area eight times bigger than Hyde Park in central London – faces opposition over claims it would be a “blight” on the countryside. The scheme, which would provide power for up to 100,000 homes, will cover nearly 2,800 acres near Newmarket, more than 10 times bigger than any scheme built to date in Britain. It is one of more than 900 solar farms in the planning pipeline to help provide green energy. Campaigners say the Sunnica energy farm, which will span several villages in Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, will change the unique character of a vast area of countryside shaped by farming and horseracing. Suffolk county council said last week it would not support the scheme in its current form. Richard Rout, deputy council leader and cabinet member for finance and environment, said: “We recognise that renewable energy is a key part of delivering energy security but it can’t come at any cost or to the detriment of Suffolk or the environment.” John James, 74, who owns Brookside Stud, near Chippenham, Cambridgeshire, said: “The solar panels will blight several villages and take farmland out of production.” He was particularly concerned over the fire safety of the vast batteries that would be housed near his stud in containers up to six metres high. Finlay Colville, head of research at Solar Media, a business intelligence and digital media firm, said there are now about 910 possible solar farm projects in the pipeline in the UK, with numbers increasing by about a third in 2021. More than 300 have already submitted planning applications or have already been approved. Colville said some of the largest projects might not be delivered but there were also many smaller sites that were being approved. “Solar farms can be built quickly, and it’s a quick win for firms and public bodies which want to have more renewable energy,” he said. While many councils support renewable energy schemes, there are concerns about some large-scale projects, including the Cottam solar project on the Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire border, covering 2,800 acres; the Mallard Pass solar farm in Lincolnshire and Rutland, covering 2,175 acres; and the Gate Burton energy park, near Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, covering 1,690 acres. Sir Edward Leigh, the Conservative MP for Gainsborough, has raised concern about such large-scale schemes. He told parliament last month: “Is it not time we looked at how we can stop these companies bypassing local planning and secure proper community gain and the protection of agriculture, and ensure that there are buffer zones around villages?” Ministers say, where possible, large schemes should use previously developed land to help preserve farmland. Many smaller schemes arise from the demand for green energy in the public sector. Work started in November on a 30-acre scheme to help power the New Cross hospital in Wolverhampton, while the Ministry of Justice has proposed a two-acre installation next to Whatton prison, near Bingham in Nottinghamshire. Sunnica said its scheme would make a “significant contribution” to help the UK meet its net-zero targets by 2050. It said it would respond to any concerns raised over its scheme in the planning process, that it took the safety of its battery storage system very seriously and thta it had a package of proposed safety measures to mitigate the risk of a fire. A government spokesperson said: “We recognise the need to preserve greenfield land while protecting the environment as we work to generate more cheap, clean power in the UK. ​Solar energy developments, including these ones, are subject to strict planning controls to protect local communities and the environment. This includes the requirement to conduct environmental impact assessments and public consultations on planning applications.”\n",

      "Text: The US federal government has stepped back from its plans to overturn state bans on the sale and possession of shark fins. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (Noaa) said in a statement on Tuesday it had decided against challenging state bans in California, Maryland and Washington. The agency said it had received written assurances from the three states that the shark fin ban would not interfere with legal fishing for shark meat. Noaa said it had initially been concerned the state bans could hurt fishermen who caught sharks for their meat, not their fins. \"It was important for Noaa to confirm that these state laws did not restrict the possession of shark fins in a way that would create problems for fishermen fishing legally for sharks in federal waters,\" the agency said in a statement. Environmental groups accused the agency last week of trying to undermine the state bans on shark fin, which they argued that dramatically reduced the slaughter of sharks. Up to 100 million sharks are killed every year for their fins, according to recent estimates. The fins are seen as a high-end ingredient in soups. In 2010, Congress passed a law banning the cruel practice of finning – cutting off the fin at sea and abandoning the animal to die. But eight states and three territories went further, banning the sale and possession of shark fins. Environmental groups say the ban on shark fin sales has been more effective in stopping the killing of sharks.\n",

      "Text: The Brazilian company JBS, the world’s biggest meat processor, has announced record profits a day after it pledged to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 – the first global meat and poultry company to do so. Surging exports to China and Hong Kong fed its record profit of 4bn Brazilian reais (£516m) for the last quarter of 2020 – up a staggering 65% on the previous year – the company said on Wednesday night. Sales to China and Hong Kong from Brazil grew by about 60%, it said. The results meant the world’s biggest protein producer had “plenty of money to spend in removing illegal deforestation from its Amazon supply chain”, as it promised to do by 2025, said Mauro Armelin, director of Friends of the Earth for the Brazilian Amazon. And it had no excuses if it failed to meet a target it originally promised to hit in 2011, he added. “They have enough money to invest in their production chain,” said Armelin. “Those billions and billions are not just to pay dividends to shareholders.” Booming exports to China and the collapse of the Brazilian real were key to JBS’s record profits, said Fernando Iglesias, an analyst at the consultancy Safras & Mercado (Harvests and Market). “JBS has always been one of the Brazilian companies that most benefited from China and always knew how to take advantage of this,” he said. The company said it proposed paying out R$2.5bn in dividends in 2021. Business is also blossoming for its Brazilian meat-processing rivals Minerva and Marfrig.  All three Brazilian meat companies have come under intense pressure in recent years to eliminate illegal deforestation from their Amazon supplier farms. They monitor the finishing farms that sell to their abattoirs – called “direct suppliers”. But they are unable to control the “indirect suppliers” selling to finishing farms or other supplier farms. Last year both JBS and Marfrig announced plans to monitor all their Amazon supply chains by 2025 and Minerva is working on a solution using a system called Visipec. On Wednesday, Marfrig said that by the end of 2020 it was already monitoring 62% of its Amazon supply chain. On Tuesday, JBS promised to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. “Climate change is the big challenge of our time,” the JBS chief executive, Gilberto Tomazoni, said in a statement. “Agriculture can and should be part of the global climatic solution.” But Armelin said much of the net-zero target would probably be met if JBS eliminated all deforestation from its Amazon supply chain by 2025 – as promised last year. Environmentalists said then that the target was too far off. “That will be JBS’s big emission factor, based on Brazilian emissions,” Armelin said. JBS has also promised to remove all illegal deforestation from its entire Brazilian supply chain – including the threatened Cerrado, or savanna region – by 2030, convert to renewable electricity by 2040 and reach zero deforestation globally by 2035. JBS has said it would invest $1bn (£720m) over the next decade in the net-zero programme. Dom Phillips is a 2021 Alicia Patterson Foundation fellow.

      "Text: Renewed questions are being asked about Australian councils’ use of international projects to offset local carbon emissions, off the back of a Guardian investigation that found 90% of rainforest credits issued by one leading company were likely worthless. The research into Verra, a world leader in the rapidly growing voluntary offsets market, found that the majority of rainforest offset credits were likely “phantom credits” and do not represent genuine carbon reductions. The company strongly disputes the studies’ conclusions, has strenuously defended its projects and challenged the methods used to undermine their credibility, saying they cannot capture the true impact of projects on the ground. They say this explains the difference between the credits it approves and the emission reductions estimated by scientists. But the revelations have energised critics of public entities for using offsets rather than concentrating on reducing their own emissions. Fifteen local governments in Australia, including those in central Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, trade offsets through Verra’s registry platform, spending millions of dollars to claim carbon-neutral status. While the vast majority are not the rainforest credits that were the subject of the Guardian investigation, and its findings are not applicable to them, they are mainly for overseas-based projects, prompting questions about why local governments aren’t spending that money trying to reduce their own emissions. Brisbane city council, Australia’s largest local government, spent $6 million last year offsetting its emissions, including banking 130,000 tonnes of carbon emissions on a landfill gas recovery and power generation project in China. University of Melbourne climate futures senior research fellow Lily O’Neill described it as “a joke” that an organisation whose core function is to dispose of waste would spend money reducing emissions on that same activity offshore. O’Neill said that offsetting was only valid as a last resort for emissions that could not be avoided. “Does anybody [at council] go out and check that these carbon credits are being generated in the way that they say they will be?” she said. Brisbane city council did not respond to Guardian Australia questions about what due diligence it does on overseas offsets projects. The Labor opposition in Brisbane, led by Jared Cassidy, has long been critical of council’s offset spending and described the Guardian investigation as a “wake-up call”. “The only large-scale action a council can take to reduce emissions on a citywide scale is remove organic material from landfill,” he said. “You can’t simply buy your way out of it. “If you want to make real change you start in your own back yard.” O’Neill said there were high-value offset projects that were working, including First Nations-led emissions reductions projects. Brisbane was among the councils that did fund some Australian-based initiatives, including Indigenous-led savannah fire management in Arnhem Land. But more than 90% of Brisbane city council’s offset funding was spent on projects abroad. Many other councils – including Woollahra in Sydney, Subiaco in Perth and Moreland, Moonee Valley, Maroondah and Yarra in Melbourne – obtained 100% of their credits from overseas-based renewable energy projects. Queensland University of Technology’s pro vice-chancellor of sustainability and research integrity, Kerrie Wilson, also advised that local governments should be “looking at things in their own back yard” as they strive to achieve carbon neutrality. “That’s challenging, because it requires a focus on our internal policies and our own practices and our own behaviours rather than relying on offsetting,” she said. Wilson said QUT had invested in a solar farm in western Queensland in an effort to achieve carbon neutrality. “You have more oversight, transparency and assurance around the integrity if they are projects that you can touch and feel and identify,” she said. Brisbane city council did not respond to questions about whether it was reviewing its offset program but did say it was currently undertaking “a major food waste recycling pilot involving 6,000 households across 30 suburbs”. A City of Sydney spokesperson said that over the past few years it had been “buying an increasing share of high-quality local carbon offsets” and aimed to have 100% high-quality Australian regenerative offsets by 2025. The City of Melbourne is understood to be reviewing its past and future offsets following the Chubb review, which this month recommended a new integrity body be set up for Australia’s carbon credits scheme.\n",

      "Text: The value of the black market industry behind crimes such as ivory smuggling, illegal logging and toxic waste dumping has jumped by 26% since 2014 to between $91bn (£62bn) and $258bn, according to an assessment by the UN and Interpol. Environmental crime is now the world’s fourth largest illicit enterprise after drug smuggling, counterfeiting and human trafficking and has outstripped the illegal trade in small arms. The impact on the natural world has been devastating in some cases. More than a quarter of the world’s elephant population have been killed for their tusks in the last decade alone, according to the joint report from the UN’s environment programme (Unep) and Interpol. Efforts to stem the global crime wave have been thwarted by weak laws, ill-prepared security forces, corruption and chronic underfunding. The report argues that new laws are needed as well as sanctions at national and international levels, the disruption of overseas tax havens, and increased crime-fighting funds. Interpol’s secretary general, Jürgen Stock, said: “Environmental crime is growing at an alarming pace. The complexity of this type of criminality requires a multi-sector response underpinned by collaboration across borders.” Unep’s director, Achim Steiner, said: “The vast sums of money generated from these crimes keep sophisticated international criminal gangs in business, and fuel insecurity around the world. The world needs to come together now to take strong national and international action to bring environmental crime to an end.” The report’s $91bn to $258bn figure is an estimate of the value of crime this year. Prior to the estimated 26% spike since 2014, there had been a 5-7% increase every year since 2006 in the value of felonies including wildlife poaching, smuggling, illegal logging, minerals theft and toxic waste dumping, the study says. As a result, the value of the black-market industry is now increasing at two to three times the rate of the global economy. ‘Environmental crime’ is a collective term to describe illegal activities harming the environment that involve illegal damage to, trade or theft of natural resources. International agencies currently spend just $20-$30m annually on tackling the crime wave, a sum dwarfed by the revenues of organised crime networks, which often overlap with drug traffickers, terror groups and militias in war-torn states. In Tanzania, the market price for the 3,000 elephants killed each year is five times higher than the national budget of the country’s wildlife protection service. Interpol is trying to encourage better coordination and intelligence sharing between the world’s national crime agencies. But a greater focus is needed on long-term investigations that can take down crime kingpins, as well as low-level poachers and smugglers, officers say. The agency’s approach to environmental crime has evolved towards more controlled operations. These can involve the use of tracking devices on smuggled cargo, satellite surveillance of major shipping routes and analysis of commodity chain data to verify how illegally sourced products reach the market. The high-profit, low-risk nature of environmental crime is matched by the low funds and uncertain priorities given to fighting it by many decision-takers. “It is a spiralling problem,” said Davyth Stewart an Interpol criminal intelligence officer. “Law enforcement is over-stretched. The profits made from these crimes are up to 10,000 times higher than the investments to combat them. There’s a very similar disparity between the profits made by organised crime gangs and the resources available to law enforcement and prosecutors.” More investment, support and capacity building was needed to help officers who were increasingly being met by armed and violent offenders, he added. Crimes with a lesser financial value but more immediate impact, such as firearms trafficking, routinely benefit from a greater security focus when environmental crime can have consequences just as profound, even if they are felt further down the line. The destruction of ecosystems can spark violence and unrest as well as social conflicts, mass migrations and the disruption of human habitats and food chains. Ibrahim Thiaw, Unep’s deputy director said: “Too often, criminals target poor communities that simply can’t afford to feed their families and bring them into the criminal chain. We need to snap this and create programmes that help people earn a living by protecting, conserving and sustaining the environment through either ecotourism or agriculture.” Unep has recruited celebrities including Gisele Bündchen, Yaya Touré and Neymar Jr to promote a Wild for Life campaign which aims to raise consciousness about the issue and mobilise public support. In an opinion piece for the Guardian, Bundchen writes: “Environmental awareness is growing all over the world. But so is wildlife crime, and the struggle between those forces seeking to preserve Earth’s rich biodiversity and those trying to turn it into illicit profits is just getting started.”\n",

      "Text: Britain will need a massive expansion of wood-burning stoves, wooden houses, wood-guzzling power stations and other similar technologies if greenhouse gas targets are to be met, the government's advisers on climate change have warned. But green campaigners said strong safeguards were needed if such a high target was to be met, to ensure that biomass use did not put pressure on forests, mainly in the developing world. One-tenth of the UK's total energy should come from biological sources – wood, energy crops, palm oil, waste and others – by 2050, compared with the 2% today, said the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) on Wednesday, the statutory body set up to advise ministers on meeting the UK's climate targets. It is the first time such a big target has been proposed. Biomass is regarded with suspicion by many environmental campaigners because growing it can displace natural forest and land that would otherwise be used for agriculture, pushing up food prices for the poor. Burning biomass cuts carbon emissions compared with burning fossil fuels, but the reductions are often small because of the energy needed to produce the crops and transport them to the incinerator. Kenneth Richter, biofuels campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said the government should look to small-scale biomass sources rather than the the large power stations envisaged by CCC. He said: \"Big industrial power stations burning huge quantities of imported wood pose a real threat to the world's forests – they should not be supported by taxpayers' money. Instead ministers should back small-scale UK biomass sources like slurry and food waste – and focus on meeting our energy needs by developing clean energy from wind, sun and waves.\" Doug Parr of Greenpeace said biomass could be part of the answer, but stronger safeguards were needed. He said: \"We have to avoid sprinting towards a bioenergy industry that relies on chopping down forests that will damage the ecosystem. Nor will the solution to our clean energy needs be found in mass imports impacting communities in both developed and developing countries. The government must have an ethical and sustainable approach to the expansion of bioenergy, without it all we will end up doing is transferring our problems to other parts of the world.\" The committee also insisted that new biomass-only power plants built from scratch should not be eligible for public subsidy. If this advice is taken up by government, it would effectively mean a halt to the current plans being brought forward by several companies to build such plants. David Kennedy, chief executive of the CCC, said the reasoning behind the advice was that building new biomass plants from scratch would not make economic or environmental sense when there are many existing coal-burning power stations that will need to be taken out of service in the next few years. If these are converted to burning biomass – a relatively straightforward process – then that would save the emissions involved in building new ones. A spokesman for Drax, the UK's largest coal power station which is hoping to convert 100% to biomass, said: \"Drax welcomes the fact that the Committee on Climate Change has concluded that biomass is a cost effective renewable, but the extent to which Drax and others in the industry are actually able to make use of biomass depends on the outcome of the Renewables Obligation Banding Review. We note the Committee's stance on new dedicated biomass plant, and are disappointed that it does not envisage a role for this technology, but again deployment will depend on the outcome of the Banding Review.\" The advice is likely to be seen as a blow to the small operators of existing and planned new dedicated biomass power plants around the country, whose business model depends on a sizeable flow of subsidies. Kennedy also warned that the UK should not seek to derive more than 10% of its energy from biomass, because exceeding the target would lead to the use of unsustainable sources of energy. He called for stronger safeguards on bioenergy, to ensure that it comes from sustainable sources where it is grown on spare land and from well-managed forests. The CCC report also made clear that biomass power plants would need to be fitted with carbon capture and storage technology in order to meet the UK's target of cutting emissions by 80% by 2050. The fledgling technology has suffered a series of setbacks recently, chiefly the collapse of plans to build a demonstration project at Longannnet power station. Longannet was the front runner in a six-year-old government competition to allocate funding to a pilot project, and although the Department of Energy and Climate Change has insisted that £1bn of funding will still be allocated, it remains unclear what the future of the CCS competition will be.\n",

      "Text: The Covid-19 vaccinations captured the world’s attention in November yet, around the same time, researchers behind a trial known as HPTN 084 also published spectacular results. The trial, which took place across seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa, found that an eight-weekly injection with a drug called cabotegravir was more effective than daily medication in an oral pill form in preventing HIV in women. An estimated 38 million people in the world are currently living with HIV – two thirds of these people live in Africa. In South Africa, more than 62% of the 7.5 million adults living with HIV are women. While a pre-exposure prophylactic pill is currently available for people at risk, the HPTN 084 trial – undertaken by the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) and partly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation – found cabotegravir to be 89% more effective. “The injection overcame many of the challenges that women in the region experience with taking a daily pill,” trial chair Dr Sinéad Delany-Moretlwe says, explaining that stigma often prevents people taking their pill consistently. “Partners may feel insecure because they think it means their partners are going to be unfaithful and just generally women experience judgments about being sexually active,” she explains. Delany-Moretlwe, who works at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, says that the injection is “discreet and convenient and not visible” and therefore “overcomes barriers” for many women in African countries. The HPTN 084 trial involved 3,223 cisgender women ranging in age from 18 to 45. Only four women who received the injection acquired HIV compared to 34 women who took the pill. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a result like this for HIV prevention in women,” says Delany-Moretlwe. “This is a product that can be used by men and women, when it’s licensed, potentially, so I think that’s what’s exciting.” “I’ve worked in HIV prevention for a long time and I know we’ve had more disappointments than successes,” Delany-Moretlwe says, but “it’s an incredibly exciting result. With introduction and use of the injection, we can hopefully begin to see the reduction and possibly elimination of HIV acquisition in young women in our region.” Amelia Tait Imagine a city where power is generated from turbines and waterways. Where cycle paths, green space, allotments, veg boxes and vegan restaurants are plentiful, buses are powered by human waste and streets are closed so kids can play. It’s not a fantasy. It’s happening today in Bristol, a city increasingly feted for pioneering environmentally friendly urban life. The first city in the world to declare a climate emergency and Britain’s first European Green Capital, it is consistently top of various green matrices. This year it was judged the most environmentally friendly big British city based on high recycling rates (47.4%), generous green space (29 hectares), council seats held by the Green party (11) and carbon emissions and gas consumption. A green virtuous circle appears to be whirling in the West Country, as environmentally conscious citizens urge their leaders to make more ambitious climate commitments. In 2014, Britain’s first “poo bus” was launched, its journeys between Bristol and Bath entirely powered by human and food waste. Bristol’s leaders have looked further ahead than most. Back in 2007, the city began powering its 34,000 street lights with green electricity and, by 2014/15, it had reduced its emissions by 38% compared with 2005. The Bristol Energy Co-operative’s most exciting new scheme proposes using the water flowing through Netham weir in the city to generate electricity. A community team working at the Lawrence Weston housing estate gained planning permission for the tallest turbine of its kind in England, which will power all 3,500 homes in the area. Other schemes include a phone app using thermal imaging to help 70% of residents who struggle to pay their electricity bills identify the energy efficiency of their homes. Traders then fix problems for an affordable fee. Mark Pepper, project development manager of Ambition Lawrence Weston, says “from being seen as a middle-class problem” paying attention to the climate crisis is now seen as a way of investing in the future. As well as being a middle-class concern, environmental issues have typically been championed by people who are overwhelmingly white. This, too, is changing in Bristol, the first major city in Europe to elect a black mayor, Marvin Rees. “Someone said, ‘I hear the voice, I hear what the voice says but I don’t hear my voice’,” says Carlton Romaine, coordinator of the Black and Green Ambassadors project in Bristol, which aims to create a new generation of environmental leaders from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. “We want to empower the BAME community because we’re always at the bottom and we’re usually add-ons,” says Romaine. “We want to be leading green projects or at least a partner, not just somebody that is asked to do something.” Patrick Barkham The Air Company, based in New York, makes vodka from two ingredients: carbon dioxide and water. Each bottle that’s produced takes carbon dioxide out of the air. It has been chosen as one of the finalists in the $20m NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE, which aims to incentivise innovation in the field of carbon capture, utilisation and storage. The company’s chief technology officer, Stafford Sheehan, hit upon the idea while trying to create artificial photosynthesis as a chemistry PhD student at Yale. Photosynthesis, you may remember from chemistry at school, is the process by which plants use sunlight to convert CO2 into energy. For 2bn years, plants were equal to the task of balancing the carbon in the atmosphere – but now we are emitting it at a rate beyond what nature can restore with photosynthesis. Hence the interest in carbon capture. “Our aim is to take CO2 that would otherwise be emitted into the atmosphere and transform it into things that are better for the planet,” says Sheehan A nice cold martini is undoubtedly better for the planet than global warming. Unfortunately, however, it would require 11 quadrillion Air Vodka Martinis to make any kind of significant impact. But Sheehan hopes to make alcohol for a variety of different applications. “Ethanol, methanol and propanol are three of the most-produced chemicals in the world, all alcohols,” he says. “Plastics, resins, fragrances, cleaners, sanitisers, bio-jet fuel… almost all start from alcohol. If we can make the base alcohol for all of those from carbon that would otherwise be emitted, that would make a major impact.” Air Company currently captures its CO2 from old-fashioned alcohol production: concentrated CO2 rising from a standard fuel-alcohol fermentation stack is transformed into vodka. That’s a fairly boutique product. However, power stations are much more plentiful sources. “You can burn natural gas, then capture the CO2 you’re emitting, and that feeds you the carbon dioxide,” says Sheehan. “That’s what we’d like to do and that’s where you can do it at scale.” Richard Godwin The Pacific Trash Vortex is the largest accumulation of rubbish in the world. Ocean currents mean the Eastern Garbage Patch near Japan is locked in a perpetual exchange of tyres, toothbrushes, discarded Minion toys, etc, with the Western Garbage Patch, between California and Hawaii. It spans more than 1m sq miles. Most of it is plastic: an estimated 87,000 metric tonnes broken down into 1.8tn tiny pieces. In 2012, a Dutch teenager named Boyan Slat gave a Ted Talk that had grown out of a school project. He revealed a plan to install a series of floating platforms that would harness those ocean currents and concentrate the rubbish in tighter areas, making it easier to remove. He founded the company Ocean Cleanup in 2013 and raised over $40m in funding. “There isn’t an instruction manual for doing this,” says Slat when I connect with him over video link – no longer a wide-eyed kid but a shaggy haired 25-year-old. After much research and trial and error, the company is now concentrating most of its efforts on rivers, stopping at source most of the plastic before it can get into the oceans. However, Ocean Cleanup achieved a significant milestone last year by extracting plastic from the ocean and turning it into something useful: sunglasses, yours for $199. The frames only represent a drop in the ocean in terms of plastic extracted, but Slat hopes they will create a virtuous circle. Each pair will fund the clean-up of up to 24 football fields of plastic from the Garbage Patch. “It would be quite poetic if we could fund the clean-up by recycling the plastic we take out.” Slat sees 2021 as an inflection point – the moment to deliver on its promises. “We have the tools to do it now. We have applied the lessons we’ve learned. Now it comes to actually doing it at scale.” What gives him hope? “The willingness of the world to address the issue. When we started, I thought the main difficulty would be people not caring – and the technology would be relatively easy. Actually it’s the opposite. But that makes me hopeful that when all the tools are there, it will actually happen. It is possible, even in this time when everything seems so polarised, to tackle problems through all the things humans are good at: entrepreneurship, ingenuity, creativity. It can bring people together. Things that seem insoluble can be solved.” Richard Godwin Antarctic blue whales Blue whales were abundant off South Georgia before industrial whaling arrived in 1904. By the 1970s they had vanished from the surrounding seas. Between 1998 and 2018 there was only a single sighting. This year, that changed: there have been 58 blue whale sightings. Kakapo The kakapo is the world’s heaviest, longest-lived parrot – a flightless, nocturnal creature which, like New Zealand’s other flightless birds, was imperilled by the mammalian predators introduced by humans. Years of conservation efforts had saved it from extinction, but then the species was struck down by the respiratory disease aspergillosis. Stricken birds were helicoptered to Auckland and treated in a human hospital with a paediatric nebuliser. The virus was contained and the population now stands at 213. Beavers It seemed like 2020 was the year every grand estate obtained a licence to release beavers into large, fenced enclosures. The beaver is increasingly valued as a natural flood-defence engineer, with its dams storing water upstream and slowing the flow of flood water, protecting towns downstream. Its ponds and channels have also been shown to benefit fish, amphibians, insects and birds. This year, the government in England allowed beavers unofficially released in the River Otter in Devon to stay, paving the way for its return as a natural native species, 400 years after being hunted to extinction. Great fox spider The critically endangered spider was feared to be extinct in Britain. But the nocturnal 5cm arachnid, known for its speed, agility and ambush hunting, has been rediscovered on a Ministry of Defence site in Surrey. Mike Waite from Surrey Wildlife Trust rediscovered the spider after being allowed in to survey the area over a two-year period. MoD sites are often wildlife havens with land undisturbed by the general public. Hen harrier A fine spring and summer across the UK meant that voles bred prolifically in the wild, in turn helping birds of prey enjoy successful breeding years. The endangered hen harrier enjoyed its best breeding year for nearly two decades. Nineteen nests produced 60 chicks. Patrick Barkham Four years ago, Rebecca Mayhew lost her job, then the pigs on the farm she owned with her husband Stuart were plagued by health problems due to the way they were intensively farmed. The couple became uneasy about the animals’ welfare and the health of their conventionally farmed land, so they sold their pigs and took a holiday in Scotland, where Rebecca fell in love with a friend’s Jersey cows. Four years on, their once-conventional arable and pig farm is a very different beast. The Mayhews have embraced regenerative farming, a way of working that aims to fix the food production system by restoring degraded soils and reducing and ultimately eliminating artificial fertilisers and pesticides. The revolution at the Mayhews’ 500-acre South Norfolk farm began with a small herd of Jersey cows. Unlike a traditional dairy, where calves are removed from their mothers after a few hours and fed formula, they chose to produce milk naturally, allowing calves to feed from their mothers, who are milked just once a day. “Looking into what’s good for the cows, and what’s good for us led us into looking at what’s good for the land,” says Rebecca. The Mayhews have jettisoned the farming orthodoxies of the past half-century. Ploughing is sacrilege: it erodes fertile top-soil. Decades of relentless scaling-up is turned on its head: big fields are turned into smaller fields – hedges replanted to stop erosion and provide shade and fodder for the cattle. Grazing fields that would normally be sown with a monoculture of rye-grass are instead seeded with up to 20 species to provide healthier food for the cattle (which, in turn, need fewer expensive veterinary drugs). Arable fields are planted with “cover crops”: so clovers are planted alongside barley or oats. Clovers are “nitrogen-fixing” plants that take nitrogen from the atmosphere and add it to soil, so it can be used by other plants – a free fertiliser and soil-improver. “Modern conventional farming is a constant war with nature. It’s about killing everything so one plant can grow,” says Mayhew. “We need to mimic nature and work with it.” The Mayhews’ new way of farming is nature-friendly so they’ve been able to take advantage of government subsidies for wildlife-enhancing farming. British farmers know that generous EU farm subsidies are coming to an end and farm payments in the future are likely to be more dependent on farms providing environmental “goods” such as healthy soils and clean water. Patrick Barkham Between the ages of 42 and 57, Bernardeta Gómez from Spain couldn’t see a thing. But then scientists embedded a port into her skull and after 16 years of blindness, Gómez was able to see again. It was all thanks to the innovations of Eduardo Fernandez, director of neuroengineering at the University of Miguel Hernández in Elche, Spain. Fernandez is working on a unique cure for blindness – instead of developing an artificial retina, he has created a device that restores sight by feeding signals directly to the brain. As the majority of blind people have damage to the nerve system connecting the retina and the brain, Fernandez’s work could help more people than developing an artificial eye. Fernandez has compared his prosthesis to a pacemaker or cochlear implants, both of which are pieces of electronic equipment that have been widely implanted into humans for more than 60 years. His system is made of a small camera attached to a pair of slightly outsized black glasses. This relays live video to a computer, which translates the footage into electronic signals. These signals are sent through a cable to a 100-electrode implant in the brain’s visual cortex (hence the port in the back of Gómez’s head), which deliver currents directly to the brain, producing sight. Gómez was able to see a low-resolution representation of objects rendered by white-yellow dots and shapes. She could see lights, letters and shapes at 10 pixels by 10 pixels. Although she couldn’t make out human faces, she was able to play a simple computer game “piped directly into her brain”. Unfortunately, the implant had to be removed after a year. “The body’s immune system starts to break down the electrodes and surround them with scar tissue,” explains Fernandez, “which eventually weakens the signal.” He hopes to continue testing his bionic eye while figuring out ways to stop the implant degrading. Ultimately, the prosthesis will be wireless. Amelia Tait Among the many novel terms that have entered our lives lately – “lockdown,” “herd immunity,” “flatten the curve” – one is decidedly more glamorous. In November it was suggested that “Dollying” should become shorthand for referencing an occasion when a celebrity does something that makes you love them even more. This was in response to the revelation that Dolly Parton had contributed $1m towards the Moderna Covid vaccine, news which was met with euphoria as we collectively – and only slightly melodramatically – exclaimed that Dolly had “saved the world”. Yet before we add “Dollying” to the dictionary, let’s consider the competition. How about “Doing a Rashford”, in reference to Man Utd’s striker Marcus Rashford forcing the UK government to confront child poverty and reinstate free meals for underprivileged schoolchildren? “Riri-ing” could also work, following Rihanna’s donation of $2m to charities supporting domestic-violence victims during lockdown. And then there’s “Pitting” (I sense this cute word game has now run its course), after Brad Pitt was spotted delivering groceries to disadvantaged LA households. The internet squealed with delight. These acts stand out in a year in which celebrities have been stripped of red carpets and live concerts and rendered impotent, left to spout platitudes over social media. Philanthropy has become common ever since Bob Geldof’s Live Aid concerts for famine-stricken Ethiopia in the 1980s, and is now so widespread it’s “almost part of the job description of an A-list star,” says Jo Littler, sociology professor at London’s City University. It is, she adds, “a form of brand promotion”. This means we have an ingrained scepticism when we see a celebrity doing a good thing: is it genuine or a PR play? Evan Ross Katz, a fashion writer and podcast host, says acts resonate when, instead of “affixing themselves to something because it’s trendy,” the celeb has a personal connection to the cause. Such was the case with Rashford, who subsisted on free school meals growing up, or ASAP Rocky, who last month delivered meals to the homeless shelter in New York where he and his mum sought refuge when he was young. Gestures needn’t be grand. Ryan Reynolds recently sent 300 parkas to a school in the remote Inuit community of Arctic Bay after the town’s mayor tweeted that they were desperate for winter gear. Justin Timberlake bought a wheelchair-friendly van for a teenager with cerebral palsy. And Taylor Swift’s longstanding custom of helping out regular folks continued when she paid for an 18-year-old to study maths at a UK university. We don’t need our celebs to be decent people but when they are – and in a way that isn’t overly forced and holier-than-thou – it provides a much-needed boost to our battered morale. Jamie Waters At first glance, Jarod Rollins’s work looks like magic. In a cove on an island off the coast of Maine, Rollins spends his days examining transparent worms in the hopes of extending human life. Of course, it’s not really magic, it’s science: Rollins works at the MDI Biological Laboratory, a non-profit research institution, and is motivated by a desire to “help people age more gracefully or even turn back the ageing process”. In July 2019, Rollins and 10 other researchers from across the globe made a monumental breakthrough: they increased the lifespan of some Caenorhabditis elegans worms by 500%. The reason these unassuming roundworms are frequently used in ageing research is because they share many of their genes with humans. An ordinary C elegans worm will live for three to four weeks – Rollins and his team kept them alive for months. “If we do make a discovery in C elegans and find a gene that helps regulate the rate at which they age, there is a good chance that that research is going to apply directly or indirectly to humans,” he explains. “I’m not in the business of making worms live longer,” he laughs, “I want to make people live longer and healthier, and worms are just one step on the way.” The worms in the experiment lived longer because his colleagues in China altered two signalling pathways in their cells. These pathways were previously both linked to ageing – in the past, experiments altering one of the pathways had doubled C elegans’s life expectancy, while experiments with the other increased the worms’ lifespan by 30%. The team expected that altering both pathways simultaneously would see worms living 130% longer. Instead, they lived five times longer. Mutating the two pathways sends signals to cells telling them to use dietary nutrients to go into “maintenance mode” instead of “growth mode” – fixing the damage caused by age. But what are the immediate repercussions? Rollins explains that scientists used to look for one “silver bullet” in anti-ageing research, but the therapies that “are going to have the most effect are probably going to stimulate multiple different genetic pathways at once… This is really going to change how people look at the ageing process.” Amelia Tait Troubled eras have always inspired positive human progress – and 2020 will be no different, says Peter Frankopan, professor of global history at Oxford University This year has been a terrible and chastening experience. But rather than allow doom and despair to sweep us away, we should be optimistic about the future – and in the long run, we might just owe 2020 a debt of thanks, rather than mutter its name with spite. The experiences of this year will – and must – teach important lessons about being better prepared for future epidemics. It will lead to greater understanding of how to plan and execute large-scale emergency responses more quickly and more efficiently and with better outcomes. And it will make us think about the risks and threats in the world around us with greater clarity and depth. The fact that Covid-19 vaccines have been developed with astonishing speed might encourage those who fear the worst about other big problems. Climate change is the most obvious mega-threat: in the long run, our pandemic experiences must help with that. While Covid hit the economy, one outcome may be smarter policy that looks to keep people in jobs, ensures towns and city centres remain vibrant and encourages small businesses to flourish and grow – rather than enabling virtual monopolies to impose strangleholds over the economy which heighten social inequalities. And 2020 has forced a recalibration of ambitions and expectations on a personal level. At the start of the year, our aims might have included a promotion or a higher salary. Today, those hopes have been replaced by something rather more modest and, indeed, better for us: to see friends, visit the pub, watch live sports, go to the theatre or visit somewhere new. Outside the pandemic, the murder of George Floyd in May proved a catalyst in raising voices who demand a fairer, more equitable and kinder society. It forced global public attention to focus on the realities of discrimination and racism, to recognise that there might be better alternatives to having statutes of rich slave-owners towering over town squares and that cultural imperialism did not end when the age of empire did. Beyond 2020? We would do well to remember that, in the past 30 years, more people have been lifted out of poverty than ever before; more children and mothers have survived childbirth; more people are able to read and write than at any point in human history. For all the horrors of the year, hope is still present – as the historian Agathias wrote in the sixth century, times of disaster throw up prophets who talk about doom and gloom and predict how much worse things will get with great certainty. Much better, then, to be positive and optimistic.\n",

      "Text: Every spring, longtime beekeeper Tony Wilsmore will start getting phone calls. Usually people see his phone number on the side of the cargo bike that he rides around the Melbourne suburb of Moonee Ponds, tending to various backyard hives in the inner north as part of his business Suburban Bees. As their garden starts blooming and thoughts turn to outside, people want to register their interest in keeping hives. “The first thing I do,” says Wilsmore, “is try to convince them that they should not keep bees.” Having grown up on farms and keeping bees as a kid, Wilsmore retired from a career in health and community services five years ago to start beekeeping full-time. He currently keeps around 22 of his own hives and tends to other hives around the inner north. Since he returned to maintaining hives, interest in backyard beekeeping has surged, with official numbers of recreational beekeepers in Australia climbing to over 28,000 nationally, up from 23,000 within five years. This global phenomenon has been fuelled by a combination of factors, including an increased awareness of the dwindling numbers of honeybee colonies, a need to connect to nature inspired by Covid lockdowns, and the appeal of honey on demand via a hobby that may seem more accessible with the advent of YouTube instructional videos. As a result, suburban bee novices have set hives on roofs, balconies and backyards in cities around the world. But this explosion of well-meaning amateur beekeepers has some experts concerned. A core part of Wilsmore’s business is to promote the environmental importance of bees and increase the number of people keeping bees, and yet when the initial phone call comes through, he says: “Look, I’m going to try and convince you not to have these. “After I’ve done my best and you still want to keep these livestock – because that’s what they are – I’m happy to come around and work with you to assess where you live, who you have in your household, the opportunities that you’ve got to keep bees and what the upsides and downsides are.” Wilsmore is encouraged by what drives people’s desire to start beekeeping, but he’s adamant those good intentions have to be matched by an awareness of the responsibilities of keeping livestock, and the wider context that their new hives operate within. Wilsmore is often the guy councils call to tend to local swarms, a phenomenon that’s increased over the years alongside the rise of backyard beekeeping and is mostly left to local councils to deal with. The risks around potential disease in hives that aren’t properly monitored has also increased. But the biggest risk for the bees themselves comes down to insufficient habitat. A combination of the destruction of habitat in both urban and regional areas, a trend towards smaller backyards, and an increase in honeybee hives in urban areas creates more competition for rural resources for both honeybees and native bees. “I think people are compelled to keep a beehive because they fundamentally want to help the bees. And my message is usually the first step to helping bees is to plant flowers,” says Fiona Chambers, CEO of the Wheen Bee Foundation, a not-for-profit charity for bees. “Before people get a hive of bees, they need to think very seriously: [are there] enough flowers, and not just in spring, but are there enough flowers across the calendar year to support the bees?” The foundation, which was started by Gretchen Wheen, one of Australia’s best-known beekeepers, supports research and education initiatives that address the national and global threats to bees, strengthen honey and native bees, improve pollination efficiency and increase food security. Those issues inevitably lead the foundation to recognise the role of all the other pollinators in our ecosystem, not least native bees (of which Australia has over 2,000 species) but also including beetles, wasps and moths. “It’s not just about bees. The big issue facing both honeybees and native bees, and other insects, is lack of floral resources,” says Chambers. A report by researchers at Curtin University, released last year, found that introduced honeybees were more effective and voracious in gathering food than their native counterparts. The two-year study of bee populations in Perth found that in residential areas, competition between honeybees and natives was especially fierce and that competition – in addition to habitat loss – risked putting some native bee species under threat of becoming endangered or extinct. Just as introduced honeybees play a crucial role in pollinating our food crops, native bees are essential when it comes to supporting native habitat, and some argue are an untapped resource for supporting Australian agriculture. Pollination is an issue much bigger than honey, and more valuable. “The total value of honey product in Australia is about $120m a year,” says Chambers. “If you look at the estimated economic value of the pollination services provided by those honeybees [managed and wild honeybee pollinators], it’s $14.2bn per year.” Cedar Anderson, the co-founder and inventor of the wildly popular Flow Hive, agrees. In one of the promotional videos for his product, he says: “Honey is almost the bonus.” “We have developed food systems that rely on the honeybee. Humans have dragged them around the world, wherever they go. And we know very well now that without them we’re in trouble,” says Anderson. “But the other part of that story is that there’s all sorts of other pollinators as well, [and] if you can’t keep honeybees alive, then it’s likely the environment, all of the other insects, are suffering as well.” In almost every recent news report on the backyard beekeeping phenomenon you’ll find a mention of Flow Hive and their contribution to the boom in popularity. It has been seven years since Anderson and his father Stuart, who together invented Flow Hive, watched as their crowdfunding campaign blew up to become the most successful crowdfunding campaign ever outside the US. Within 15 minutes of going live, the campaign had attracted US$250,000 in preorders. The duo’s hive reimagines the way honey is extracted (it comes out of a tap) after Anderson, a beekeeper since the age of six, was inspired to create a system that didn’t crush bees in the extraction process, and was more time efficient and less messy. Anderson and his dad quickly realised their product’s appeal was far wider than they imagined. “It became very clear very quickly that it was inspiring a whole new crowd of beekeepers in the world.” Some beekeepers have been critical of Flow Hive for attracting novice beekeepers with what they argue is the suggestion that backyard honey is as easy as turning on a tap. But others argue the company has generated a renewed interest in beekeeping, and that presents an opportunity to harness the enthusiasm of a captive audience. Anderson says he and his father decided they wanted to help inform their instant customer base. “We really got quite quickly into making content around how to keep these bees,” he says. “It just became clear that education was the key.” This was motivated by a sense of responsibility towards the bees, “but also a responsibility for the customers that they’re successful in their new pursuit”. Flow have since invested in a series of education and regeneration programs, including an online beekeeping course and the Billions of Blossoms project launched earlier this year with the goal of creating billions of new flowers for pollinators through a mix of reforestation and habitat protection and funded in part by their beekeeping course. Anderson says about half of their customers are new to beekeeping and are attracted to Flow for the appeal of the honey delivery system, but also because they’re interested in contributing to pollination efforts. “The honeybees are a gateway insect into viewing the world in a more interconnected way where not only honeybees, but humans, have a place in the natural systems,” explains Anderson. “The feedback we get from people that are new to beekeeping is that they tend to suddenly realise the interconnectedness of what’s going on in their local surrounds because their hives are bringing in nectar from a 10km radius. And all of a sudden they’re like, well, hang on a second. I need to put away the insecticide, get out the habitat.” Wilsmore agrees. Apart from urging novice beekeepers to go join a club, “go and play with some bees”, and get a feel for them before they don the suit in their own backyard, he says the best thing “bee people” can do is plant plants. “If you’re lucky, you’ll be attracting some native bees as well. Yes. And that’s even better.”\n",

      "Text: The world is off track to meet the goal of tripling renewable electricity generation by 2030, a target viewed as vital to enable a swift global transition away from fossil fuels, but there are promising signs that the pace of progress may be picking up. Countries agreed last December on a tripling of renewable power by the end of this decade. But few have yet taken concrete steps to meet this requirement and on current policies and trends global renewable generation capacity would only roughly double in developed countries, and slightly more than double globally by 2030, according to an analysis by the International Energy Agency. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said: “The tripling target is ambitious but achievable – though only if governments quickly turn promises into plans of action. Countries worldwide have a major opportunity to accelerate progress towards a more secure, affordable and sustainable energy system.” Governments should include targets and policies on renewables in their national action plans for the climate (called nationally determined contributions, or NDCs), which are a requirement under the Paris agreement, the IEA found. Many currently fail to do so, even though vast increases in renewable power are essential to meeting the treaty’s aspiration of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The IEA, the gold standard for global energy research, analysed the domestic policies and targets of nearly 150 countries, and found they would result in about 8,000GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. That amount is about 70% of what is necessary to reach 11,000GW of capacity, the amount needed for the tripling goal agreed at the Cop28 UN climate summit in Dubai last year. Solar power makes up about half of the capacity governments are planning to install, with wind making up about a quarter. Heymi Bahar, a senior energy analyst at the IEA and co-author of the report Cop28: Tripling Renewable Capacity Pledge, said: “There is a gap, but the gap is bridgeable.” Last year, there was a record increase in renewable capacity, amounting to about 560GW added in one year, a 64% increase on the new capacity added in 2022. Solar and wind are still cheaper than fossil fuels, and the IEA does not foresee that changing. There is plenty of solar manufacturing capacity, and supply issues with wind power components are being resolved. Some wind companies that had been in difficulty owing to high component prices were moving back to profitability, said Bahar. Some countries are moving faster than their national targets. Last year, China added more new renewable generation capacity than the rest of the world combined. “It was incredible,” said Bahar. “Everyone was very surprised. One of the reasons is that solar and wind are so much cheaper than coal.” Governments now need to focus much more attention on upgrading their electricity grids, which are a major block on progress in many places, Bahar added. “Countries have been allocating lots of support to renewables, but the grid has been forgotten. Regulatory action is needed.” He said countries could move faster now to ensure that the tripling target is met. Governments are meeting this week and next in Bonn, headquarters of the UN framework convention on climate change secretariat, to discuss the pledges made at Cop28, and progress towards the Cop29 conference, which will take place this November in Azerbaijan. One of the key items under discussion will be climate finance, and how to increase the finance available for developing countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. For developing countries, including renewable energy plans in their NDCs – which are due for an update ahead of the Cop30 climate summit in Brazil next year – can be an essential first step towards gaining the finance that they need. Katye Altieri, an analyst at the thinktank Ember, said: “Solar and wind provide three-quarters of global growth, as they have proven their ability to scale rapidly to provide cheap, secure and clean energy. Technologies like bioenergy have failed to gain traction, not only because of costs but also the risk of emissions and wider social and ecological impacts.”\n",

      "Text: The Prince of Wales has called for small family farmers in the UK and across the world to come together in a cooperative movement using sustainable farming methods, and for their plight to be at the centre of environmental action. Small farmers, in the UK and EU, are facing their biggest upheavals in more than a generation, with the loss of farm subsidies and new post-Brexit trade deals in the UK, and sweeping reforms to the EU’s common agricultural policy to be announced this week in Brussels. Writing for the Guardian, Prince Charles has urged small farmers to band together to cope with the coming shocks and shift to a low-carbon economy: “There are small farms the world over which could come together in a global cooperative committed to producing food based on high environmental standards … With the skills of ethical entrepreneurs and a determination from the farmers to make it work, I would like to think it could provide a very real and hopeful future.” Farming is undergoing a “massive transition”, and the needs of family farmers must be taken into account, the prince said. “To me, it is essential the contribution of the small-scale family farmer is properly recognised – they must be a key part in any fair, inclusive, equitable and just transition to a sustainable future. To do this, we must ensure that Britain’s family farmers have the tools and the confidence to meet the rapid transition to regenerative farming systems that our planet demands,” he said. Analysis of farming data for the Guardian has shown that small farmers were already facing an increasingly difficult future, before the shocks of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic. The EU has lost vast numbers of livestock farms in particular, with 3.4m gone between 2005 and 2016, the latest year for which full data was available. At the same time, the number of livestock on farms has increased on average, a clear sign of intensification in the sector. In the UK, a quarter of livestock farms, amounting to 45,500 farms, were lost in 12 years from 2005 to 2016. That loss was part of a longer-term trend for all farms, with more than 110,000 farms gone from the 319,000 farms in 1990. Many farmers have warned that Brexit could hasten the loss of smaller farms, as the UK’s markets open up to lower-cost imports from outside the EU that previously faced tariffs and other barriers. The government has been phasing in new support for farmers, based on payments for providing public goods such as tree planting, wildlife protection and nurturing the soil, but it is still unclear how these will work in practice. Ministers also announced a consultation last week on giving lump sums to farmers who want to retire, accompanied by support for people who want to enter farming, but cannot afford to. However, some farmers concerned that the scheme will encourage a further exodus of small farmers. The Prince of Wales has long been a supporter of sustainable farming, and earlier this year launched Terra Carta, a roadmap to 2030 for businesses to move towards a low-carbon and environmentally sustainable future. He said this could provide a template for farmers coming together in cooperatives to reach consumers who are increasingly interested in buying locally and from small-scale producers. “These [small] farmers are some of the most hard-working and innovative small businesses and, in so many ways, we depend on them far more than most of us will ever know,” the prince wrote. Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers’ Union, echoed his views: “We would not want to see a loss of the traditional family farm. We would lose the culture and heritage of this country, where 70% of the land is farmed and the expectation is that at the end of every farm track is a family. Our national identity is built on this.” Small farmers in the UK are increasingly worried about what Brexit will mean for them, with the government’s approaching trade deal with Australia provoking widespread unease. Many farmers told the Guardian they were alarmed at the impact an influx of cheap meat and other produce could have on small farmers and the British countryside. Liz Lewis, who with her husband, David, farms 650 hectares (1,600 acres) in north Wiltshire, including a beef cattle herd producing 100 calves a year, said: “This will be curtains for small livestock farmers. There’s a lot fewer already. It won’t happen overnight, it will be a slow burn, but in a few years you will see it.” She warned that the UK’s landscape would be transformed, as has happened in the US, into widespread factory farming with a green veneer. “It’s sad for the younger generation – it’s really hard to see how they can make money unless they intensify, by going for big feedlots [of the kind common in the US],” she said. “You have to imagine what the countryside will be like in 10 or 20 years’ time – it will not be what we’re used to. There will be more trees, but behind those trees there will be industrialised farms.” Tim Ashton, in north Shropshire, said the impact of the loss of small farms was already evident, even in the most rural areas. “What we’re seeing around us is social cleansing. Local people can’t afford to live here and small farms are disappearing. There is a lot of gentrification happening – you expect to see that in Cornwall or the Cotswolds but now it’s even coming here.” Consumers would also lose out from the decline of small farms, said Ruth Hancock, a self-described “new entrant” who faced many barriers to setting up as a small farmer. She said: “We are at great risk of creating a two-tier food system akin to that in the US, where we may end up having a few smaller or organic producers supplying the concerned and better-off citizen. Meanwhile, the vast majority have to make do with the lowest common denominator imports, because they can’t afford to buy better or don’t understand the difference.” A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Our landmark plans for a renewed agricultural sector will transform the way we produce food and support farmers in England. Through these changes, rather than paying farmers and landowners for the amount of land they manage, we will pay them to provide environmental and animal health and welfare outcomes. We are phasing out the current subsidy, the basic payment scheme, in a phased and progressive way. This means that initially those who claim smaller amounts of subsidy will receive a smaller reduction in their payments when we make the first reduction later this year.” Research on data for this piece by Kunal Solanky Sign up here for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

      "Text: While the world must wait to see whether US president-elect Joe Biden can fulfil his election promise of a $2tn Green New Deal, nations elsewhere in the world are setting carbon-neutral targets and pushing ahead with mega-programmes to cut emissions, create jobs and reduce energy prices. Here are some of the regional frontrunners. Under the coalition of its socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, Spain has picked up the pace from a jog to a run in its break from fossil fuels this year, and is now one of the countries leading the European pack. Last week, the government was the latest to announce plans to go carbon neutral by 2050 and it is overseeing one of the fastest shifts away from coal the world has seen. Over the coming three years, Spain has committed €27bn to green energy spending – a downpayment on the €750bn investment it forecasts will be needed to fund the move away from fossil fuels. By 2050, the decarbonisation strategy envisages a 90% reduction in emissions, the reforestation of 20,000 hectares and the recovery of 50,000 hectares of wetlands. Renewable power, meanwhile, will rise from 20% of the energy mix to 97%. Action is already under way. In May, the cabinet approved a draft law on climate change, which outlined more ambitious goals than the EU at the time on renewables and energy efficiency. The bill would ban new coal, oil and gas extraction projects and end direct fossil fuel subsidies. Spain is also shutting down 69% of its coal-fired power plants this year and next – a pace of decommissioning not seen anywhere else in the world. Last year, Spain installed more new onshore wind than any other country in Europe. Far from being a drain on employment and economy, the Spanish government says its decarbonisation plan will increase the workforce by 1.6%. But the country will have to convince investors that its legal framework is more stable this time than during the “solar garden” bubble that followed subsidy promises in 2007. When those were abolished, confidence in the sector took at hit along with jobs. The ecological transition minister, Teresa Ribera, predicts the country will go well beyond the 2030 targets set by the European commission and has promised to push for still more ambitious policies in Spain and elsewhere in Europe. This is part of a broader trend. In Europe, renewables have generated more power than coal for the first time this year. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has said she wants Europe to be the world’s first carbon-neutral continent. Over the next 10 years, the commission forecasts investment of at least €1tn to achieve this goal, including a quarter of the EU budget. This month, the European parliament voted in favour of climate neutrality by 2050 and 60% cuts in emissions by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels). Further progress has been seen in individual countries, including Denmark, Germany, France and (outside the EU) Britain. Four years after being labelled the world’s biggest carbon villain, South Korea has bid to be one of the heroes this year with a $61bn Green New Deal and a commitment to go carbon neutral by 2050. President Moon Jae-in has moved to end South Korea’s dependence on coal and create green jobs as his party promised in April’s successful election campaign for the national assembly. By 2025, the Green New Deal would bring about 230,000 more energy-saving buildings, 1.13m electric and hydrogen-powered cars, and an increase in renewable energy capacity to 42.7 GW from 12.7 GW last year. Money will also be made available to upgrade public rental housing and schools to make them zero-energy, and to expand green areas in cities. To improve energy efficiency, smart meters will be fitted in an additional 5 million apartments and communities will be given incentives to connect to micro-grids supplied with decentralised, low-carbon energy. The plan aims to support Korean industrial conglomerates that have been hard hit by the pandemic. Hyundai, Kia, Samsung and EM Korea will be among the biggest beneficiaries of plans to build 45,000 new electric vehicle charging points and 450 hydrogen refuelling units. Tempering the optimism is South Korea’s past record of high emissions and false hopes. The last time the country promised “green growth” – after the 2008-9 financial crisis – it led to an environmentally disastrous policy of more concrete riverbanks and higher emissions. Today, coal supplies about 40% of Korea’s electricity and seven new coal power plants are under construction. In 2016, activists labelled South Korea the world’s biggest carbon villain. A new generation of campaigners believe South Korea has turned a new page. They want to see an early halt to overseas coal financing and a strong 2030 target to reduce domestic emissions. They are encouraged by signs of a climate race-to-the-top in east Asia, where the opposite has long been true. China and Japan are also major users and funders of coal, but both countries have committed this year to carbon-neutral goals. Last year, Uruguay was ranked fourth in the world in the proportion of electricity it supplies from wind and solar. The International Energy Agency said the country’s 36% share was behind only Denmark (50%), Lithuania (41%) and Luxembourg (37%). If hydropower is added, Uruguay leaps ahead of them all with 97%. This represents a spectacular transition. Twenty years ago, this South American country burned oil to produce almost a third of its electricity and had to import power from Argentina. The change came between 2008 and 2015 under former presidents Tabaré Vázquez and José Mujica, who wanted to reduce costs and make energy more affordable. The secret was a proactive state rather than a big-spending one. Government encouraged investors by promising fixed feed-in tariffs and stable policies. More than US$7bn poured into the sector, helping Uruguay to reduce its emissions by 20%. Droughts have also been rarer because the grid is less dependent on hydropower. Asad Rehman, the co-organiser of Global Green New Deal Campaign, said the success of Uruguay’s transition reflects an ideal balance of social and climate priorities. “It is not just about carbon, but also cutting energy prices and tackling energy poverty. Social justice is an imperative.” The picture is mixed elsewhere in South and Central America. Costa Rica has won international kudos for generating almost all of its electricity with renewables, particularly geothermal and hydropower. The latter also provides most of the power for Brazil and Paraguay though it often has a devastating impact on ecosystems and wildlife. Renewables already provide more than 93% of Kenya’s electricity and the government plans to expand further so everyone in the country has access either to the grid or community solar power by 2022. The carbon footprint of the population of 47 million is tiny compared with wealthy nations in the northern hemisphere so economic – rather than climate – considerations are the main drivers for an energy transition. Solar, wind, hydropower and geothermal energy is increasingly cheaper and more practical than fossil fuels. The main challenge is securing the initial investment. The country has substantial renewable resources to tap, prompting many observers to say it has the potential to bypass fossil fuel-driven economic development. Last month, the African Development Bank announced the completion of the 105 MWe Menengai geothermal power plant in the Rift Valley, cementing Kenya’s leading role on the continent for geothermal electricity production, which has increased more than fourfold in the past six years. Kenya is also home to east Africa’s biggest solar generation plant – the $128.5m China-funded Garissa Plant where more than 200,000 PV panels soak up the energy from the sunshine each day. In many remote areas, small villages that are far from the grid are able to generate electricity with just a few dozen rooftop panels. These developments – along with expanded wind and hydropower – have pushed the proportion of the population with electricity from 63% in 2017 to 75% today. Heymi Bahar, the lead author of the International Energy Agency’s Renewables market report, said Kenya along with other African nations, such as Rwanda and Nigeria, “have a chance to leapfrog” fossil fuel energy systems if they can draw in more private investment. That once meant expensive subsidies, but Bahar said this is no longer the case. Good regulations and policies are enough. “Renewables are becoming cheaper and more accessible. In Africa, the potential is there, the willingness is there,” he said. “Renewables do not need subsidies any more. They just need long-term revenue streams. That is determined by clear policies.”\n",

      "Text: Two in five of the world’s plant species are at risk of extinction as a result of the destruction of the natural world, according to an international report. Plants and fungi underpin life on Earth, but the scientists said they were now in a race against time to find and identify species before they were lost. These unknown species, and many already recorded, were an untapped “treasure chest” of food, medicines and biofuels that could tackle many of humanity’s greatest challenges, they said, potentially including treatments for coronavirus and other pandemic microbes. More than 4,000 species of plants and fungi were discovered in 2019. These included six species of Allium in Europe and China, the same group as onions and garlic, 10 relatives of spinach in California and two wild relatives of cassava, which could help future-proof the staple crop eaten by 800 million people against the climate crisis. New medical plants included a sea holly species in Texas, whose relatives can treat inflammation, a species of antimalarial Artemisa in Tibet and three varieties of evening primrose. “We would not be able to survive without plants and fungi – all life depends on them – and it is really time to open the treasure chest,” said Prof Alexandre Antonelli, the director of science at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, in the UK. RBG Kew led the report, which involved 210 scientists from 42 countries. “Every time we lose a species, we lose an opportunity for humankind,” Antonelli said. “We are losing a race against time as we are probably losing species faster than we can find and name them.” The UN revealed last week that the world’s governments failed to meet a single target to stem biodiversity losses in the last decade. The researchers based their assessment of the proportion of species under threat of extinction on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List. But only a small fraction of the 350,000 known plant species have been assessed, so the scientists used statistical techniques to adjust for biases in the data, such as the lack of fieldwork in some regions. They also used artificial intelligence to assess little-known areas. “We now have AI approaches that are up to 90% accurate,” said Eimear Nic Lughadha, a senior research leader at RBG Kew. “These are good enough to say, ‘this area has a lot of species that haven’t been assessed but are almost certainly threatened’.” In 2019, Nic Lughadha reported that 571 species had been wiped out since 1750, although the true number was likely to be much higher. The 2016 State of Plants report found one in five were threatened, but the new analysis reveals the real risk to be much higher. The main cause of plant losses is the destruction of wild habitat to create farmland. Overharvesting of wild plants, building, invasive species, pollution and, increasingly, the climate crisis are also important causes of losses. Billions of people rely on herbal medicines as their primary source of healthcare, but the report found that 723 species used as treatments are threatened with extinction. These include a type of red angel’s trumpet in South America used for circulatory disorders that is now extinct in the wild and an Indian pitcher plant traditionally used for skin diseases. “Only 7% of [known] plants have documented uses as medicines and therefore the world’s plants and fungi remain largely untapped as potential sources of new medicines,” said Melanie-Jayne Howes, a research leader at RBG Kew. “So it is absolutely critical that we better protect biodiversity so we are better prepared for emerging challenges to our planet and our health.” Prof Monique Simmons, who researches the uses of plants and fungi at RBG Kew, said nature was a key place to look for treatments for coronaviruses and other diseases with pandemic potential: “I am absolutely sure going forward that some of the leads for the next generation of drugs in this area will come from plants and fungi.” The report also highlighted the very small number of plant species that humanity depends on for food. This makes supplies vulnerable to changes in climate and new diseases, especially with the world’s population expected to rise to 10 billion by 2050. Half the world’s people depend on rice, maize and wheat and just 15 plants provide 90% of all calories. “The good news is that we have over 7,000 edible plant species that we could use in the future to really secure our food system,” said Tiziana Ulian, a senior research leader at RBG Kew. These species are all nutritious, robust, at low risk of extinction, and have a history of being used as local foods, but just 6% are grown at significant scale. Potential future foods include the morama bean, a drought-tolerant South African legume that tastes like cashew nuts when roasted, and a species of pandan fruit that grows from Hawaii to the Philippines. Stefano Padulosi, a former senior scientist at the Alliance of Biodiversity International, said: “The thousands of neglected plant species are the lifeline to millions of people on Earth tormented by unprecedented climate change, pervasive food and nutrition insecurity, and [poverty]. “Harnessing this basket of untapped resources for making food production systems more diverse and resilient to change should be our moral duty.” The report also found the current levels of beekeeping in cities such as London was threatening wild bees, as there was insufficient nectar and pollen available to support beehive numbers and honeybees were outcompeting wild bees.\n",

      "Text: Rishi Sunak plans to restrict the installation of solar panels on swathes of British farmland, which climate campaigners say will raise bills and put the UK’s energy security at risk. Last year, then prime minister Liz Truss attempted to block solar from most of England’s farmland. The plans were deeply controversial and unpopular, and were dropped when she left office. However, solar panels in the countryside are disliked by many rural Conservative MPs, and the Observer can reveal that Sunak and environment secretary Thérèse Coffey have revived plans to put new restrictions on this form of cheap renewable energy. This is the latest weakening of green policies before the general election, which started when the Conservatives won the Uxbridge byelection, a result widely attributed to anger at Labour mayor Sadiq Khan’s ultra low emissions zone.  Sunak recently announced that the 2030 phase-out of new petrol and diesel cars will be pushed back to 2035, as well as weakening the 2035 gas boiler phase-out, confirming it will apply to far fewer homes. The government also plans to scrap pollution rules for housebuilders in sensitive areas, where they are currently not able to add to sewage pollution without paying to improve nearby wetlands. It has also faced criticism for its record on renewables, with its stance on onshore wind referred to by industry as an effective block, and the recent government renewable energy auction failing to sign up any offshore wind. Sunak will further dilute green policies, say campaigners, by giving new powers to planning officials in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). These would allow officials to block any solar project that can be argued to “put food security at risk” – that is, anywhere food is grown. Ministers are understood to believe that food security should be on par with energy security and will use recent climate breakdown-related food shortages in Europe and the war in Ukraine as justification for the change. The framework amendment to the NPPF was drafted by Greg Smith, the MP for Buckingham, who has long campaigned against solar panels on farmland. He said: “This is a clear, straightforward protection that planning authorities up and down the land can use to say this development on this farmland isn’t going to hit our food security in this area, or this one over here is and therefore use that as a good reason to turn down applications.” Coffey confirmed the NPPF will be coming out later this year and that “the first purpose [of farmland] must have to be about food production”. Energy experts have strongly criticised the plans. Lydia Collas, senior policy analyst at Green Alliance, said: “Solar energy will help us move away from polluting fossil fuels, and in the long term protect UK farming from climate breakdown. Restricting ground-mounted solar would be gravely short-sighted. ” Alethea Warrington, senior campaigner at climate charity Possible, added: “It is mindblowing that as the UK faces yet another winter of unaffordable energy costs caused by reliance on dirty gas, the government would make it still more difficult to build the clean, cheap energy we desperately need.  “The idea that solar power could interfere with the UK’s food security is utterly detached from reality. Solar power generated over 8% of all our electricity this spring, but takes up less land than golf courses. This is part of an abysmal streak of energy policy from the government, including failing to properly unblock onshore wind, failing to get any new offshore wind, and trying to press ahead with incredibly dangerous new oil drilling.” A Department for Levelling up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said the NPPF consultation aimed to prioritise food production but no decision on the wording had been made. “We received thousands of replies to our consultation and are considering these before responding.”  This article was amended on 8 October 2023. Greg Smith is the MP for Buckingham, not Buckinghamshire as an earlier version said.\n",

      "Text: Australia’s largest east coast gas producer has sought federal environmental approval to drill up to 7,700 new gas wells in Queensland, prompting concern from environmentalists due to the project’s sheer size and its proximity to two national parks. Australia Pacific LNG – a joint venture between Origin, ConocoPhillips and Sinopec – has lodged a referral under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to expand its “Gas Supply Security Project” and drill across an additional 476,492ha of central and south-west Queensland. The relevant tenements include land bordering both Carnarvon national park and Expedition national park. Referral documents show the proposal would potentially impact 26 plant and animal species and six threatened ecological communities. Two environmental groups, Lock the Gate Alliance and Don’t Frack the Outback, say the plan would “transform rural localities and communities into industrial gasfields”. “I could not believe it when I heard about this application,” Leanne Brummell, spokeswoman for Don’t Frack the Outback, said. “This expansion demonstrates the insidious nature of unconventional gas – once a company starts pockmarking the landscape with gas wells, it doesn’t stop. “Landowners in this region have spent years battling drought, and they will now be forced to negotiate with gas companies over access to water.” In its referral documents, APLNG says a justification for the expansion includes predictions by the Australian Energy Market Operator of a gas supply shortfall from 2024. Aemo’s most recent “gas statement of opportunities” provided an improved outlook for gas supply, based on the impact of a new import terminal at Port Kembla. Lock the Gate Queensland spokeswoman Ellie Smith said the most recent Aemo report showed there was “absolutely no justification for new fracking gasfields that destroy water and farmland”. APLNG’s referral documents also propose using horizontal or directional drilling to allow pipelines to go “under threatened ecological communities, threatened flora, threatened fauna habitat and migratory fauna habitat”. Pipelines would not be allowed under national parks. “While [APLNG] may not technically be able to drill within Carnarvon Gorge national park, it will be permitted to destroy many thousands of hectares of surrounding land that currently supports threatened animals like the koala,” Smith said. The referral seeks permission for a “maximum development scenario” that would involve 7,700 wells, each requiring a construction footprint of about 1.5ha, gas and water pipelines, gas processing facilities, water management facilities and supporting infrastructure. In a statement, Origin Energy, the “upstream” operator of APLNG’s gasfields in Queensland, said the documents outlined maximum well numbers. A company spokesman said that decisions about the eventual scope of the project – including about the requirement for hydraulic fracturing – would be made “during final development planning” and would comply with state and federal approvals. “Our natural gas production delivers secure domestic supply, where APLNG provides about 30% of annual east coast demand, and plays an important role in supporting Australia’s transition to renewable energy,” the Origin spokesman said. Origin said Queensland communities gained significant economic benefits from its gas projects. “From 2017-18 to 2019-20, the value of Origin’s expenditure with local businesses across Banana Shire, Central Highlands, Maranoa and Western Downs was approximately $187m.”\n",

      "Text: Dependency on coal in key parts of the world is preventing a global green recovery from taking off, and the shift away from coal needs to be made a global priority, the head of the world’s energy watchdog has said Coal still forms a key part of China’s energy system, and plans are in train for further coal-fired power plants in the country. India is also heavily dependent on coal, and despite increasing its renewable energy generation has shown little sign of reducing its use of the fossil fuel. China’s greenhouse gas emissions last year climbed higher than their 2019 levels, preliminary data shows, in a blow to hopes that the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic would set the world on a greener path. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA) and one of the world’s foremost energy economists, said: “Our data indicates a strong rebound in China’s emissions in the second half of 2020. From April onward, monthly emissions in China surpassed the levels of 2019. If this strong trend is confirmed through December, Chinese emissions for the whole of 2020 may well catch up with the 2019 level, despite the sharp decline in the first quarter of 2020.” China approved more new coal-fired power generation in the first half of last year than in the whole of the previous two years, according to Global Energy Monitor and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. China is the world’s biggest emitter, and if its efforts to recover from the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic are focused on propping up its existing economy, rather than fostering green growth, global emissions will be strongly affected. “This is not good news at all,” Birol told the Guardian. “Many countries believe [coal] is still a cheap and domestic source of energy generation, and more importantly, in many countries coal is still the largest employment source.” He pointed to India, where coal is a huge employer. There are more than half a million miners in the country, and more employed indirectly, in energy generation and on the railways, for which coal is the biggest source of freight. China, India and others must grapple urgently with their coal use, said Birol. “The challenge will be how we can find ways to an early retirement of coal plants – this is absolutely critical,” he said. If the same pattern of continuing investment in coal and other fossil fuels is followed in other key emerging economies, such as in Indonesia, where coal use is also heavy, then the chances of a global green recovery will be much reduced, according to Birol. The swift acceleration of carbon dioxide output after the coronavirus lockdowns was a warning that the global recovery from the pandemic would cement higher greenhouse gas emissions for the future if urgent action was not taken, he said. Governments should choose to push for green energy in seeking growth to lift their economies out of recession, he added, because “wind and solar are the cheapest sources of energy generation”. Birol warned last summer that the world had six months to change direction and refocus on a green recovery from the pandemic. But although much of what has happened since was of concern, he said there had been positive signs. Fossil fuel subsidies had fallen globally from about $330bn (£240bn) to $200bn (£146bn) a year, and the share of clean energy investments had risen from one-third of all energy investment five years ago to about two-thirds today, he said. “Some countries did listen. They have done a good job, and have followed a more sustainable path. But the majority of countries did not.” Even in countries where green measures were being highlighted, there was no room for complacency, Birol said. He pointed to the massive growth in greenhouse gas emissions from SUVs, which make up half of all car sales around the world, with disastrous effects on current and future emissions. “The share of SUVs of total car sales has skyrocketed,” he said. Stopping that surge from undermining the climate fight was up to politicians, he added. “Governments have to find financial instruments to support the good and make life difficult for the bad.” Many countries are now grappling with a second wave of Covid-19 infections, and while vaccines are being rolled out, new variants are also threatening across the world. Countries are still facing huge economic upheaval as a result of the pandemic. But Birol urged leaders not to lose sight of the need to step up their green ambitions. This was a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to reset the global economy on a path to net zero emissions, he said, adding: “I don’t think it is too late for a green recovery.” The actions of the world’s two biggest emitters over the next few months will be key. “China has its next five-year plan,” said Birol, referring to the Chinese government’s economic blueprint, which is being finalised in Beijing and is expected to be unveiled in March. “That can include green energy policies.” China’s plan will be crucial, because coal-fired power plants built now would have an expected lifetime of 40-50 years, which could dash hopes of the country meeting its stated target of net zero emissions by 2060. “It is much more costly to phase out [plants] before their economic lifetime is over,” said Birol. Joe Biden in the US also had an opportunity to shape the global response, Birol said. The new president will host a global climate summit on 22 April, at which the US plans for emissions cuts within the next decade – known as a nationally determined contribution or NDC under the Paris agreement – are likely to be a focus, along with the his ambition to focus US stimulus spending on kickstarting a low-carbon economy. Birol said: “I expect in 2021 the US, Japan and South Korea, as well as some emerging countries such as India, will put clean energy technologies at the heart of their economic recovery. To reach net zero, and their climate ambitions, and to prepare their energy sectors for tomorrow.”\n",

      "Text: 作为陆地上体积最大的野生动物，声音如雷、体重可达六吨的大象可谓是生物演化史上的一个奇迹。除了它们那有着10万块肌肉的灵活无比的鼻子，和能帮助它们驱走热量的特大号耳朵之外，大象族群还有着复杂的母系社会结构，它们甚至还会在同伴逝去之后恸哭哀痛。而大象的另外一个特征就是长长的象牙，这本来应该是它们保护自己的防卫武器，然而却最终成为了族群濒危的导火索。 相比于其他子类，非洲象和亚洲象与远古时代的长毛猛犸象关系更近。据说，大象的耳朵算是分辨其地理种族的一个标记。亚洲象的耳朵一般较小，与印度半岛形状相似；而非洲象的耳朵较大，形似整个非洲大陆的样子。 亚洲象的栖息地曾经由波斯（今伊朗）海岸经印度和东南亚向东一直延伸至中国大陆腹地。而在非洲，大象的足迹则北至地中海沿岸，南到好望角一带。大象主要栖息于热带草原地带。然而无论是撒哈拉、纳米比亚沙漠，还是卢旺达和婆罗洲的热带雨林，许多其他地形中也依然可以见到大象的踪迹。如今大象的活动范围已经开始缩减，在中东、印度尼西亚爪哇岛、北非以及中国大部分地区，大象已经几近灭绝。几乎所有地方，可供这些庞大的野生动物生存的栖息地都在不断缩小。 据粗略估计，1800年时仅非洲一地的大象总数就有2600万头。但是在经过了多年的盗猎和栖息地破坏之后，现存的大象数量与200多年前相比，已经显得微不足道。 据估算，目前亚洲现存大象数量不足5万头，其中超过一半左右都在印度。还有一小部分，也就是几百到几千头，则坚守在东南亚各国以及喜马拉雅山脉附近。 非洲象的总数比亚洲象多，但是目前距离族群灭绝也是又近了一步。目前非洲现存大象数量不足50万头，主要集中在非洲南部国家。在非洲西部以及森林密集中心区域，大象的处境尤其堪忧。 过去几千年来，象牙制品一直备受追捧，而这也是导致大象被猎杀的主要原因。公元前1323年，古埃及法老图坦卡蒙（Tutankhamun）据说就是头枕象牙下葬的。而在临近的叙利亚，象牙猎取导致当地大象在公元前500年就已经基本灭绝。 枪支的发明更是增加了大象灭绝的压力。大型动物狩猎在19世纪的殖民者中风靡一时，非洲大陆的各种野生动物都难逃这一厄运。在亚洲犯罪团伙资助下，再加上非洲冲突引进的各种武装设备，让幸存下来的这些为数不多的种群再度面临当地猎户和现代盗猎团伙的威胁。 有些专家认为，大肆屠杀大象的目的不是为了商品贸易，而是为了土地。随着全球人口不断膨胀，对空间的需求也日益上升。通过盗猎，很容易便将大象从原有栖息地上驱逐了出去，为后续的开发提供了充足空间。这种情况在西非地区尤其常见，当地大象数量的下降状况尤其严峻。到2050年，现有大象栖息地中有63%都将被人类侵占（pdf）。 在土地争夺更为激烈的亚洲农村地区，人象之间的冲突更加明显。象群的一次夜间觅食足以毁掉多个小型农户一年的粮食收成。人类生存也同样处于危险之中。在印度，受到惊吓或暴怒的大象每年会造成至少400人死亡（pdf）。面对这样的情况，人类选择了报复。野生动物主管部门通常会猎杀这些问题大象。而在印度尼西亚，油棕榈种植户每年都会毒死几十头大象。 二战过后，非洲国家逐渐摆脱了殖民统治，然而大规模盗猎行为却也开始逐渐抬头。上世纪七八十年代，英国动物学家伊恩·道格拉斯·汉密尔顿（Ian Douglas Hamilton）为了清点大象数量，曾乘坐轻型飞机横跨撒哈拉以南非洲各国，从而让这场著名的“象群大屠杀”大白天下。据他估算，上世纪八十年代非洲象的数量已经从100万头下降到了40万头。 若没有汉密尔顿（Hamilton）不顾危险而从事的这项工作，各国政府也不会最终共同决定，从1989年起全面禁止国际象牙贸易。得益于此，1989年到2008年间，全球象群数量出现了短暂的回升。然而，在犯罪团伙象牙贸易渗透、亚洲市场需求高涨以及政府机关腐败滋生等因素的共同作用之下，盗猎行为再度猖獗起来，而由此带来的影响也是毁灭性的。 去年一年就有2万头非洲象因为象牙贸易丧生，数量甚至超过了当年非洲象的出生总量。而中国的财富膨胀更是助长了象牙贸易的气焰，我们在有生之年甚至可能看到野生大象的彻底灭绝。 可以说，大象如今面临的种群危机是前所未有的。无论是殖民地时期的工业掠夺，还是上世纪七十年代亚非独立运动带来的盗猎肆虐，都未曾让大象像如今这样面临如此巨大的生存危机。 尽管有全球贸易禁令（参见《联合国濒临野生动植物国际贸易公约》——《华盛顿公约》）的约束，非法象牙贸易依然出现了井喷。有人认为，为了在全球经济衰退中隐匿资金，应该有不少投资人购买了大量的非法象牙制品并储存在了秘密仓库之中。通过贿赂当地官员，犯罪团伙将大批的非法象牙制品从港口运送到中国、云南、马来西亚和泰国的非法加工厂和市场中。仅2011年查没的非法象牙制品总量就高达23吨，相当于猎杀了2500头大象。然而，这也只是未经干扰的统计总数中的一部分。 包括纳米比亚、津巴布韦、南非和博茨瓦纳在内的多个非洲国家表示，其国内的象牙库存正在逐年增长，来源既有盗猎罚没也有自然死亡，国际社会应当允许他们对这些库存进行销售，以换取资金开展大象保护工作。 其实， 1999年和2008年曾分别进行过两次类似的库存销售。但是，有人指责这样的做法刺激了市场需求，可这一说法也遭到一部分人的质疑。而津巴布韦和纳米比亚也提出要再次销售库存象牙。该提议将在今年9月召开的《华盛顿公约》（CITES）三年一度的大会上进行讨论。也有很多国家出于象征性或实际性原因选择直接对象牙制品库存进行了焚烧。 在很多国家，象牙销售依然是合法的。当然，商品来源通常是罚没库存，或国际禁令出台之前被杀死的大象，主要目的还是为了把这些古董销售出去。《华盛顿公约》（CITES）对此表示担忧，认为中国、日本、缅甸和越南等国未经规范的国内市场可能会允许新鲜猎杀的象牙制品混入合法库存，从而间接加剧非法盗猎危机。 1）保护栖息地 保护亚洲象的关键还在于土地和栖息地保护。亚洲的确存在大象盗猎行为，但是其危害却比不上土地破坏。与那些非洲远亲不同，亚洲象中只有雄象才有象牙。大象保护工作主要就是要打击那些合法或非法侵占土地、采伐、修路和其他土地开发行为。当然，一些创新手段也能派上用场。比如印度的茶叶种植区就利用短讯服务（Short Message Service，简称SMS）预警系统来保证大象和人类可以安全和平共处。 2）减少需求 非洲的盗猎象牙制品绝大多数都流入了亚洲市场，所以保护大象的关键就在于彻底消除现有的象牙市场需求。日本就是最好的例子。日本曾是全球最大的象牙制品市场之一，而从本世纪初开始，其在象牙市场上所占份额已经微乎其微。 而在中国，国内外名人参与的环保广告宣传似乎也产生了效果。2012年到2014年间，认为大象盗猎有问题的中国人比例已经从47%上升到了71%。此外，中美政府也决定展开合作，终结全球非法象牙贸易。去年，中国开始逐步关停其国内的象牙制造与销售企业；而作为全球第二大象牙贸易市场的美国也开始积极打击国内象牙市场。 由于在殖民地时期对大型捕猎活动的狂热，欧洲人对历史上大象数量的减少负有不可推卸的责任。而如今，欧洲拒绝支持长期禁止象牙贸易的做法也招致各种批评。有观察家认为，拯救大象的唯一方法就是赋予它们经济价值，比如强调大象在旅游产业的价值。但是欧盟却依旧允许一些国家在象群数量稳定的前提下，合法采集象牙并将这些产品销售到中国。 3）支持前线环保卫士 盗猎和贫穷之间的关系很明显：婴儿死亡率与盗猎活动活跃性有很强的相关。在肯尼亚，一个盗猎者每销售一公斤象牙可以得到3美元，这比当地的日平均收入水平要高很多。但是，从他们手中收购象牙的团伙却转手以每公斤1100美元的价格销售给中国。很多大象沦为盗猎对象可能并不仅仅是因为象牙，这种情况在中非的森林地区尤其明显。在非法肉市中，一个有头脑的猎户通过烟熏象肉赚到的收入可能比象牙还要多（pdf）。所以说，非洲农村地区的发展与贫穷问题对于大象保护至关重要。 面对这样的重重威胁，也有不少勇敢人士站了出来。在肯尼亚，一些“金盆洗手”的盗猎者受雇成为国家公园的护林员，站在了打击猎杀大象的最前线。然而多数情况下，这些勇士都难逃殒命的厄运。而正是这些勇士、各种非政府团体以及许多国家政府的不懈努力，才让我们看到了一丝希望。贪婪和绝望带来的挫败感有时是难以想象的。但是我们无法想象未来大象会从地球上消失，所以也许这才是激励我们前行的动力吧。\n",

      "Text: The UK government will defy scientific doubts to place a massive bet on technology to capture and store carbon dioxide in undersea caverns, to enable an expansion of oil and gas in the North Sea. Grant Shapps, the energy and net zero secretary, will on Thursday unveil the “powering up Britain” strategy, with carbon capture and storage (CCS) at its heart, during a visit to a nuclear fusion development facility in Oxford. Shapps said the continued production of oil and gas in the North Sea was still necessary, and that the UK had a geological advantage in being able to store most of the carbon likely to be produced in Europe for the next 250 years in the large caverns underneath the North Sea. “Unless you can explain how we can transition [to net zero] without oil and gas, we need oil and gas,” he said. “I am very keen that we fill those cavities with storing carbon. I think there are huge opportunities for us to do that.” Shapps pointed to the £20bn the government is planning to spend over 20 years on developing CCS, which he said would generate new jobs and make the UK a world leader in the technology. Among the 1,000 pages of proposals to be published on Thursday will be boosts for offshore wind, hydrogen, heat pumps and electric vehicles. A green finance strategy, to be set out by the chancellor of the exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, will be aimed at mobilising private-sector money for investments in green industry, and there will be a consultation on carbon border taxes, aimed at penalising the import of high-carbon goods from overseas. But the plans contain no new government spending, and campaigners said they missed out key elements, such as a comprehensive programme of home insulation and a full lifting of the ban on new onshore wind turbines in England. Ministers are also thought to have rejected or modified scores of the 130 policy recommendations made by Tory MP Chris Skidmore in his review of the net-zero strategy, published in January. For instance, oil and gas companies will not be forced to stop flaring, and the ban on sales of new gas boilers from 2035 will not be brought forward. Meanwhile, the government is in the midst of a new licensing round for North Sea oil and gas development, which will run until next June, and oil and gas companies, which have made record profits in recent months, are proposing new developments, encouraged by tax breaks for investment in fossil fuel assets under the windfall tax. Proposals under consideration include a potentially massive new field called Rosebank, which campaigning group Uplift said could receive an effective subsidy of £3.75bn under the windfall tax. Scientists told the Guardian that an overdependence on CCS was ill-advised. More than 700 scientists have written to the prime minister asking him to grant no new oil and gas licences, describing CCS as “yet to be proved at scale”, and the UN secretary-general called on governments last week to stop developing oil and gas. Bob Ward, head of policy at the Grantham Institute, said CCS technology would be needed for certain industries, but that using it to enable the continued use of fossil fuels was a mistake. “What does not make sense is to carry on with further development of new fossil fuel reserves on the assumption that CCS will be available to mop up all the additional emissions. While the costs of CCS will come down, it will make fossil fuel use even more expensive, and it will not eliminate all the risks resulting from the price volatility and energy insecurity of fossil fuels. A successful and competitive economy in the future will be powered by clean and affordable domestic energy, not unreliable and insecure fossils fuels,” he said. “CCS is not required if the government moves to renewables as quickly as possible – especially as I am unaware of any CCS that works,” added Mark Maslin, professor of earth science at UCL. Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate at Manchester, said: “When it comes to energy emissions, the claimed prospect of CCS continues its long-established role in supporting the development of the oil and gas industry and in further delaying real cuts in emissions. Given the huge cost, very high-life cycle emissions and appalling record of working as promised, there is little, if any, merit in pursuing CCS as a major plank of UK energy strategy.” Emily Shuckburgh, director of Cambridge Zero at Cambridge University, who organised the letter by scientists, said: “Advancing CCS is important because there are some sectors that are hard to decarbonise which will require it if we are to rapidly reach net zero. However, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is clear that the level of greenhouse gas emissions this decade will determine whether temperature rise can be limited to 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels]. In that context, the focus of our energy strategy must be on scaling up proven renewable technologies, developing energy storage, supporting energy efficiency and reducing demand.” The government’s plans could also face legal challenge. The “powering up Britain” strategy is in large part a response to a high court ruling last year, when a judge agreed with campaigners that government policies at the time were inadequate to meet the legally binding commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The court ordered a rethink, with a deadline of the end of this month. Mike Childs, head of policy at Friends of the Earth, which led the case, said lawyers would closely examine the documents and return to court if the proposals did not add up. “These plans look half-baked, half-hearted and dangerously lacking ambition,” he warned. “These announcements will do little to boost energy security, lower bills or put us on track to meet climate goals.” Alok Sharma, Tory MP and former president of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, said: “The announcements made are a very welcome step in the right direction and rapid delivery is now vital. However, what we still need to see is that big bazooka moment, commensurate with the scale of the challenge. We cannot afford to wait for the government to set out the UK’s strategic response to green growth initiatives from other nations, like the US Inflation Reduction Act, which is helping to hoover up billions in private-sector investment right now.”  This article was amended on 30 March 2023: an earlier version said that carmakers would not be set a target for the proportion of electric vehicles they sell. However, the government is currently consulting on this subject with a proposed trajectory of sales towards 100% in 2035.\n",

      "Text: The war in Ukraine and spike in the price of natural gas have underlined the benefits of switching to “green hydrogen” production as the only “net zero energy gas”, according to the British firm ITM Power. The Sheffield-based company, which manufactures electrolyser machines that make hydrogen from water, said the energy crisis had shown hydrogen represents a viable alternative to methane gas. However, widening losses and the departure of the company’s longstanding chief executive, Graham Cooley, spooked investors, with shares in ITM falling 26% in early trading on Wednesday. Most hydrogen is “grey hydrogen” produced from fossil gas. An alternative to this process is “blue hydrogen”, which uses carbon capture to reduce emissions, but this method still fails to capture between 5% and 15% of the CO2. Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water using electricity from renewables, with minimal emissions. Backers of the technology argue that hydrogen could present a solution to decarbonising heavy, polluting industries. There are questions, however, over the method’s cost. Cooley said that since the start of the year, as prices of methane and fertiliser have increased, green hydrogen has “achieved first parity and then become cheaper in many cases than producing these commodities from gas feedstocks”. He added: “There is only one net zero energy gas that can replace methane to help the world address climate change. Green hydrogen can also help to deliver energy security and contribute to food security through the production of green ammonia for fertilisers. “These abilities have become very powerful drivers for our business as governments seek to accelerate the share of intermittent renewables in their countries’ energy mix to address dependence on weaponised gas supply from Russia.” ITM, which is listed on London’s AIM exchange, posted revenues of £5.6m for 2022, up from £4.3m a year earlier. However, pre-tax losses widened from £27.6m to £46.7m. Last November, the company raised £250m to expand its manufacturing capacity. Cooley, who has led the company for 13 years, will remain in post until a successor is found. Hydrogen has long been touted as a significant option for the future of fuel. The government published a hydrogen strategy in August 2021, setting out a target to double the UK’s hydrogen production to 10 gigawatts by 2030. Last month the Guardian revealed that ScottishPower is planning to build a £150m green hydrogen plant at the Port of Felixstowe to power trains, trucks and ships. The company said demand for the green fuel had stepped up since petrol and diesel prices began to soar last year, emboldening the firm to invest.\n",

      "Text: Every year, carbon emissions from cars, factories and power plants across the planet rise inexorably. The resulting elevation in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere mean that in 30 years temperatures on Earth will be 2C hotter than they were in pre-industrial times, scientists say. This is the maximum temperature that they believe the world can tolerate without there being devastating environmental consequences: spreading deserts, worsening storms and widespread flooding. Therefore, the first and most important decision that world leaders need to take at the Paris climate talks next year is to agree, through a binding commitment, that 2C is the upper, acceptable limit of global warming on Earth. All other decisions taken in Paris will follow as a consequence of that agreement. Delegates to the Paris talks will then have to establish a network of creditable commitments from individual countries, as well as power blocks such as the EU, that will achieve carbon emissions cuts to ensure the 2C limit is achieved. The devil will be in the detail when it comes to making these agreements. Once nations have agreed to make a particular cut in their carbon output, it will be necessary to set up a commission or group whose job will be to monitor nations’ emissions to check that they are keeping to their commitments.  Most of the carbon dioxide that has been added to the atmosphere is the handiwork of the industries of developed nations. Developing countries, which have produced relatively little carbon dioxide, will demand a clear commitment from these rich nations to provide financial support to help them adapt to a hotter planet and to mitigate against the worst effects of global warming. Last week a total of $9.3bn was pledged by the west to setting up such a green climate fund. However, by 2020, the amount of money needed for this purpose is expected to be around $100bn a year. If this sort of money is not pledged by the developed world, developing nations will refuse to sign any deals in Paris.  Even if nations can come up with a binding agreement that will keep the global temperature rise to 2C, there will be environmental impacts that, for some nations, will be not just damaging but utterly devastating. For example, islands such as the Maldives and archipelagos in the Pacific already face inundation, as do large tracts of coastline in Bangladesh. Levels of carbon dioxide currently in the atmosphere make the future of these look increasingly untenable. Compensation for loss and damage to populations who could lose their homelands will need special attention and a mechanism will have to be agreed in Paris to ensure these people are properly recompensed for many generations to come. Technology will be a key factor in holding temperatures to a modest level. New forms of tide, wave and wind power plants will have to be developed to replace generators that rely on fossil fuels. Other engineering solutions will need to include systems for preventing carbon dioxide from being emitted by power plants, a process known as carbon capture and sequestration. Some of these systems will be funded by governments, some will be developed by private companies. A method to allow systems created in one country to be shared with other countries in an equitable manner will have to be agreed to ensure the rapid take-up of technologies that will be crucial to efforts to keep global warming within bearable limits.\n",

      "Text: There were wisps of snow in the liverish sky over Main Street, Mexborough. I passed a shop offering cash for clothes, 40p a kilo, across the road from a tattoo parlour, and then stopped outside its shuttered neighbour. This was, from 1938, the family home of Ted Hughes. The poet’s parents ran it as a newsagent’s. But Hughes’ true domain was the open country just across the Don, reached via the old chain ferry. The river seemed to him “more or less solid chemicals – bubbling, fuming, multicoloured”, he later wrote. But, when I crossed the bridge downstream, a grebe was sliding across gunmetal water clean enough for his beloved salmon. Denaby Main colliery, which dominated the valley of the poet’s youth “like the darkest badlands”, closed in the late 1960s. An area here, flooded by mining subsidence, was later turned into a nature reserve. The young Hughes mostly inhabited two places, one being the copses and quarry of Manor Farm, where he would trap mice to sell the skins at school. The fields then were busy with partridge and hares. After he left for Cambridge, in 1951, the copses were grubbed up and the farm turned into one giant field, the farmhouse, to his horror, becoming a pub-restaurant. The other place was the small lake stuffed with giant pike on the Crookhill estate, on the hill above Conisbrough with its ancient church and Norman castle. Here too there was “soul-damage” to come: revisiting in the late 1960s Hughes wrote to Assia Wevill about how the fishpond had become “a black basin of mud, with oil cans and rubbish”. Crookhill is now a municipal golf course; the old fishpond is tidy enough, but choked with rushes. Hughes discovered his name carved in a tree here. I found the corpse of a crow, half smothered in dead leaves, “his every feather the fossil of a murder”, as Hughes wrote in his poem Crow. Recalling how the poet was attuned to omens, this was disheartening, but then a boisterous charm of goldfinches settled in an alder overlooking the pond, filling the snow-flecked sky with their chattering song. The golf course, briefly, became a garden of earthly delights.\n",

      "Text: In all the debates on how to curb climate change, hemp is hardly mentioned. Better known as cannabis, modern varieties of hemp are too weak to use as narcotics, but they are extremely efficient at absorbing and locking up carbon.  Hemp is one of the fastest-growing plants in the world and can grow 4 metres high in 100 days. Research suggests hemp is twice as effective as trees at absorbing and locking up carbon, with 1 hectare (2.5 acres) of hemp reckoned to absorb 8 to 22 tonnes of CO2 a year, more than any woodland. The CO2 is also permanently fixed in the hemp fibres, which can go on to be used for many commodities including textiles, medicines, insulation for buildings and concrete; BMW is even using it to replace plastics in various car parts.  But unlike many other countries, the UK still classifies industrial hemp as a controlled drug, and growing the plant needs a Home Office licence. Cultivation in Britain is only about 800 hectares but work at the University of York and Biorenewables Development Centre aims to increase this to 80,000 hectares and make hemp a leading UK crop.\n",

      "Text: The Ebro delta appears to be in robust health, to a casual observer. There is water gurgling in the canals and irrigation channels, and what appears to be a mighty river flowing into the sea. The dazzling green rice fields are dotted with ibis, egrets and redshanks. However, all is not what it seems. The Ebro, the only one of Spain’s three great rivers that flows into the Mediterranean, is one of the most abused and exploited in Europe. It rises in Cantabria in northern Spain and along its 910km (560-mile) course its waters are interrupted and extracted by 70 dams before it drains, literally exhausted, into the Mediterranean in southern Catalonia. More than 90% of the sediment, the lifeblood of the delta that feeds the shellfish offshore and fertilises the paddy fields, is dammed upstream and never reaches the sea. “In a healthy delta there would enough sediment to cope with rising sea levels, even with climate change,” says Maite Martínez-Eixarch, a biologist at the Institute of Agrifood Research and Technology (IRTA), based in Sant Carles de la Ràpita in the delta. “It’s part of a natural system. But 99% of the sediment is captured by the dams.” The Ebro is the climate crisis equivalent of the canary in the coalmine. Estuaries and river deltas act as an early warning that all is not well, from rising sea levels to invasive species. Spain’s east coast is soft, made up of dunes and mudflats, and in areas such as the Ebro delta, not only is the sea rising but the land is sinking. About 70% of the delta is only 50cm (20in) above sea level and, with rising sea levels and without the sediment to hold it back, the sea is gaining ground, eroding the coast at a rate of five metres a year. Mike Elliott, professor of estuarine and coastal sciences at Hull University, says: “You’ve lost natural habitats such as salt marshes and sea-grass beds and when these are removed the system loses some of its resistance and resilience.” Estuaries are also especially prone to what Elliott calls a “triple whammy” of increased urbanisation and industrialisation, increased use of resources (space, fish, water etc), and decreased resistance and resilience to climate change. Pilar Marcos, a biologist and biodiversity coordinator at Greenpeace, says: “These are areas which are often already heavily built up, often not in compliance with zoning regulations.” For deltas, global heating exacerbates what has been a long history of abuse and neglect stretching back half a century. Martínez-Eixarch’s colleague Xavier Benito says: “Rather than climate change, it would be more correct to speak of global change because it’s also about the overexploitation of the river. The delta is last in line to feel all these impacts.” Nowhere is the coastal erosion more keenly felt than in Riumar, at the mouth of the river. “This is the most fragile part of the delta, where the river meets the sea,” says Eutimio Mauri, president of Riumar council. He says that if action is not taken soon, Riumar’s 700 citizens may soon be among Europe’s first climate refugees. The Spanish government has an obligation under European Union directives to conserve the delta and is due to publish its long-awaited rescue plan next month. From what little is known of the proposals, the plan is to create what is in effect a new coastline, 280 metres inland from the current limits. Sand dunes would be built up to hold back the sea. In the process, however, 422 properties, including homes and restaurants, would have to be abandoned. The plan is not welcomed by local resident Juan Miguel Bellaubi. “Aside from anything else, the sand dune wouldn’t last a day if we had another storm like Gloria,” he says. In 2020, Storm Gloria swept through the delta’s slender defences and drove seawater three kilometres inland, destroying thousands of hectares of rice fields. Mauri prefers using undersea, intelligent breakwaters, a plan favoured by the regional government. Martínez-Eixarch also says that IRTA designed a pilot scheme to siphon off the sediment – which is a problem to the electricity companies as it can clog up the dams – and let it flow back downstream where it belongs. But she believes there is no one answer to the problem. “We need nature-based solutions,” she says. “Dykes would help in the short term but they’re expensive. Protecting dunes and restoring wetlands would be a natural way of protecting against erosion and a more effective medium- and long-term solution. They also improve water quality and increase biodiversity.” Climate change and international shipping has also brought unwelcome visitors to the delta in the form of several invasive species. Among these are the voracious blue crab (Callinectes sapidus), a species native to the eastern US that has almost wiped out native crabs. Other American invaders – the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and the island apple snail (Pomacea maculata) – threaten the region’s vital rice-growing industry. On the other side of the country, on Spain’s Atlantic coast, estuaries in Galicia, known as the Rías Baixas, are also plagued by invasive species. More than half the 400,000 tonnes of mussels consumed in Europe every year are produced in Galicia and the Ebro delta. In the Ría de Arousa, the largest of Galicia’s estuaries, a sea snail (Ocinebrellus inortatus) that originates in Japan and usually feeds on oysters has diversified its diet and is now gobbling up the ría’s mussels and clams. Alexia Costas, a local biologist, says the snails can consume 3kg (6.6lb) of shellfish a year. Mussel farmers have collected close to 150,000 of the creatures, which would otherwise have consumed 450 tonnes of their crop. What makes estuaries so fragile is the balance between the river and the sea, says Elliott. “Anything you do that interferes with this connectivity screws up the system.” Yet, in spite of everything, Martínez-Eixarch and Benito are optimistic, citing a growing public consciousness and political will to find solutions. “The delta is a complex system because there are economic interests, such as the rice growers, fishermen and tourism, and then there’s the ecology,” they say. “But we think we can find a solution that works for everyone.”\n",

      "Text: Perhaps the message was too familiar. With the unofficial election campaign under way, and the prime minister mired in escalating allegations of bullying and duplicity, a major report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – the world’s most respected climate science body – quickly disappeared from the Australian news cycle this week. The report, the third major release from the IPCC’s sixth assessment of the published evidence, focused on greenhouse gas emissions cuts – what has happened to date and what is necessary from here. Headlines told part of the story: it was “now or never” if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The report suggests that threshold is already practically out of reach without using technology to suck carbon dioxide from the sky. Keeping heating below 2C, which would trigger damage several magnitudes worse than 1.5C, will require an “abrupt acceleration” of effort after 2030. In a sane world, this alone may be enough to make it a focus of political discussion, now and through the election. But there was much more. The report suggests a rapid reduction in emissions over the next decade is within the world’s grasp – if leaders, policymakers and investors are motivated. Here are some key lessons relevant to Australia. Any suggestion there isn’t technology that could deliver deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions this decade – as scientists and leaders at UN climate talks have repeatedly said is necessary – should be dispelled by this report. This is a key point in Australia given the Morrison government’s “technology, not taxes” mantra. The Coalition’s focus is on supporting technologies that are not yet commercially viable with an expectation they will deliver cuts mostly after 2030 and closer to 2050. It rejects calls for policies to rapidly deploy clean technology now, equating them to “taxes’’ that increase costs. The IPCC report tells a different story. It takes a global view and is not policy prescriptive, but says there are options available to cut emissions across all areas that already make economic sense. In several cases it suggests they would cost less than continuing with the polluting status quo. As the Australian National University’s Prof Frank Jotzo, a lead author on the report, spelled out this week, the IPCC found global emissions could be cut by 50% by 2030 through affordable steps. Jotzo says the general findings of the report are “very readily applied to Australia”. Solar and wind power are the obvious cases. Their average costs fell by 85% and 55% respectively in the decade to 2019. The IPCC estimates building a lot more of both could cut emissions by about 5bn tonnes a year – nearly 10% of the global total – by 2030 while saving governments and consumers money compared with the alternative. They could deliver nearly 3bn tonnes more for a relatively low cost. The ramifications for Australia are potentially significant. Compared with nearly every other country, it has vast amounts of sun and wind and no shortage of space in which to harness them. The IPCC implicitly supports the idea that there is a strong economic argument to quickly boost renewable energy deployment beyond the current pace of expansion as part of a campaign to “electrify everything”, including transport, farms and major industry. The report lists other options that could lead to cuts that were either cheaper than what we have now or would cost relatively little. Programs that reduce demand for energy are a big one – they save money. Other familiar ideas that could be accelerated include improving buildings’ and industry’s energy efficiency, boosting carbon sequestration in agriculture and stopping native forest clearing. Other cheap options are yet to get much traction in Australia at the federal level. Transport is a big one. The IPCC’s data suggests shifting to more fuel-efficient cars and trucks and relying more on public transport, bikes and e-bikes makes economic sense and is good for the planet. These aren’t revolutionary ideas, just ones that have been resisted until now. On fue- efficient cars, the Coalition planned a policy that would have required a reduction in average emissions from the national car fleet – basically, forcing auto companies to sell cleaner cars – but dropped it after industry and internal pushback, despite receiving advice it could benefit the economy by up to $13.9bn. It is part of the reason the Australian car fleet remains dirtier than other comparable countries and the country trails most others in embracing electric vehicles. Despite persistent claims to the contrary from industry and fossil fuel-friendly MPs, the IPCC makes it clear that promotion of coal and gas – a favourite pastime of Australian politicians – is making it harder to keep global heating to 1.5C. The basic argument is straightforward: if existing fossil fuel plants run for their expected lifetimes, the world will blow the carbon budget to keep the temperature rise below that level. New developments only add to that. To keep the goals of the landmark Paris climate agreement within reach, countries should embark on a dedicated effort to decommission, cut back and cancel fossil fuel projects – or be prepared to spend even more on nascent technology to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In reality, both are likely to be needed. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, thundered this point as the report was released, describing investments in new fossil fuel projects as “moral and economic madness”, and that countries that were increasing fossil fuel production – not activists – were “the truly dangerous radicals” on climate change. He didn’t name Australia this time – that was last month when he called it a “holdout” on climate change for refusing to strengthen 2030 emissions reduction targets – but the message was clear. The Morrison government has not been swayed. It is backing a “gas-fired recovery”, including opening up new basins with the potential to release extraordinary amounts of greenhouse gas, as vital for the country’s future after the pandemic. Labor does not oppose the expansion. Scott Morrison has also declared the country’s coal plants should run for “as long as they possibly can” and the resources minister, Keith Pitt, cheered a recent surge in coal and gas demand after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Australia is the world’s third-biggest fossil fuel exporter, with government economic forecasts suggesting it will export more than 200m tonnes of thermal coal and about 80m tonnes of gas each year between now and 2027. The government argues there is no need to change this until demand dries up. It says developing countries need coal and gas to grow, that gas reduces emissions overseas by replacing coal (no evidence supplied) and that the focus should be on steps that give fossil fuels a future in a low-emissions world, including developing technology such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) and “blue” hydrogen made with gas. But the IPCC suggests supporting continued use of fossil fuels overseas can lock in polluting energy sources that are increasingly more expensive than renewables. And attempting to add CCS to fossil fuel energy just makes it even more expensive. This is a big one in Australia, where governments have committed more than $4bn to try to make the technology viable. The Morrison government has kicked in hundreds of millions. The IPCC makes clear CCS – stopping emissions going into the atmosphere, usually by burying them underground – will have to prove economically viable for fossil fuels to have a future in a world that keeps heating below 2C. Despite having targets that assume more than 3C of warming, Australia is notionally committed to this. One of the government’s “stretch goals” under its technology investment roadmap is to get the cost of CCS to under $20 per tonne of emissions. The IPCC report suggests this remains a long way off. A table on the likely average cost of technologies available this decade puts CCS among the most expensive. The science body has revised down its assessment of how much of global electricity it expects to come from fossil fuels with CCS in 2040 since the last time it reported from 5% to 3%. The report says polluting industries want CCS to work as it could “allow fossil fuels to be used longer”, reducing the likelihood of assets becoming stranded. But despite having been promised for decades, and having had billions of dollars in funding committed to it in Australia alone, CCS still only captures about 0.3% of the 34.6bn tonnes of annual global emissions released burning fossil fuels. This one shouldn’t be overstated, for obvious enough reasons. Global emissions continue to rise, though the pace has slowed since 2010. But there is evidence that serious efforts to cut emissions work. In 2016, steps such as accelerating available technology, backing energy efficiency and slowing deforestation lowered the global total by 5.9bn tonnes. That’s about a 10% cut. The report says at least 24 countries have cut emissions in absolute terms over at least a decade. The problem is that these cuts are outweighed by rapid growth elsewhere. In Australia, the government points to evidence that national emissions are down about 20% since 2005 – and has called on other countries to “follow our leadership” – but the headline number relies on greenhouse accounting sleights of hand that mask the reality. Fossil fuel emissions – the main game – were rising before the Covid-19 lockdowns hit due to increases from transport, mining and major industry. Government projections suggest those sectors will do little to reduce their impact before 2030. The claimed reduction since 2005 mostly happened when Labor was in power, between 2007 and 2013. Even then, it was mostly due to state policies that slowed the country’s extraordinary pace of forest destruction for agriculture, particularly in Queensland. Australia is still clearing native forests, just at a slower pace. Under greenhouse accounting, that counts as a cut in annual emissions. But it is not evidence of a country transforming its economy. The IPCC report suggests there is another way ahead. A question for MPs on the campaign trail might be: who is listening?\n",

      "Text: Wild Justice is seen by many as the disruptive new kid on the block. The environmental group has ruffled the feathers of countryside goliaths – the shooting and farming industries – and yet its main ally is the greatest establishment of them all: the law. “Wild Justice gets called lots of names,” says one of its founders, Dr Mark Avery, who was the RSPB’s conservation director for nearly 13 years. “We’re told we’re extremists, we’re zealots, and we’re activists, but what we’re doing is extremely middle class. We’re just using the law and saying ‘you’re not allowed to do that’.” Avery runs Wild Justice with the TV presenter and conservationist Chris Packham, and raptor conservationist Ruth Tingay. “It’s three mates, with no staff, just larking about,” says Avery. Going to court is not what most people consider to be larking about, but that is what the group specialises in, with the help of lawyers at Leigh Day. They are not lobbying for new laws, but making sure the government sticks to the ones already in place. The group was created in February 2019 and went straight for the jugular by challenging England’s three general licences that name bird species which can be shot as “pests” if they are believed to be damaging crops, spreading disease, affecting endangered species or putting public safety at risk. There is no evidence some of these birds, which include wood pigeons, crows, magpies and jays, are pests, Leigh Day argued. Natural England – the government’s wildlife watchdog – acknowledged its legal point and without warning temporarily removed the three general licences. The furore rippled across rural communities, attracting the sort of attention most conservationists are unaccustomed to. Farmers were shocked because they had only 36 hours’ notice that licences were being removed, and said they had no legal means to control “problem” birds that might damage crops or livestock in the meantime. Some conservationists were also angry at Natural England’s timing because it was the start of breeding season. Birds such as crows and magpies are believed to plunder the eggs and young of some endangered bird species, and conservationists too were left with no legal means of controlling them. Packham found dead crows hanging outside his home. After a prolonged legal dispute, the licences were legally changed on 1 January this year. No native species are now listed on all three of the general licences, though some are still on individual licences. This amended licensing system currently only applies to England. In January, Natural Resources Wales said the Welsh general licences were lawful, following legal action from Wild Justice. Wild Justice has not challenged general licences in Northern Ireland or Scotland, although Scotland removed certain bird species from the general licences last year. Avery says that wildlife charities and NGOs have been too soft and nice when it comes to protecting nature, and that now is the time to play hardball. He adds: “The building industry, the shooting industry and the farming industry have been absolutely tough and resolute in getting their members what they want. We have to be every bit as tough and resolute. “You can’t just go ‘yeah, we’ve listened to you and yeah we’ve decided not to do anything’ – if you have a strong legal point, they’ve got to do something.” The group’s second big case concerned the release of about 60 million non-native game birds every year. Pheasants and partridges eat native insects and reptiles, which is likely to have an impact on ecosystems. About two-thirds of game birds are not shot and retrieved, and those that die of other causes unnaturally increase scavenger populations, the group argued. Wild Justice’s legal argument was that the government had not properly assessed the impact these non-native animals had on protected sites, which it had a statutory duty to protect under the EU’s habitats directive. In October the government announced it would add the pheasant and red-legged partridge to the Wildlife and Countryside Act, classifying them as “non-native pest species”, meaning they acknowledged they could cause ecological damage. In January, the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said it would bring in an interim licensing system later this year for game bird managers working on shoots in England. People are expecting to have to apply for a licence to release birds within 500 metres of special areas of conservation and special protection areas. Avery says this is a good start but he wants all sites of special scientific interest to be included and says the distance should increase. “If they stick to 500 metres, they might well find that they’re facing another legal challenge – this isn’t over yet.” The Welsh government says it intends to bring in restrictions for 2022, but it is not clear if these restrictions will be the same as those in England. There has been no action in Northern Ireland or Scotland. Critics of Wild Justice say the group’s actions are unhelpful at best. Tony Juniper, chair of Natural England, said making legal challenges could lead to positive outcomes for conservation, but added: “In my experience legal challenge on its own is rarely sufficient to achieve long-lasting conservation benefit, and usually needs to be combined into broader strategies that also seek to change hearts and minds and to bring people together. “One concern I have at the moment is how many conservation debates have become highly polarised, making it harder to achieve progress on the ground. Sometimes, legal actions can make that worse.” Garry Doolan, deputy director of communications and public affairs at the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, said Wild Justice had won publicity but lost the countryside. The association argues that it has made general licences more complicated but would have little on-the-ground impact, adding: “Their combative approach has alienated farmers, rural businesses, the shooting community and even conservationists.” The National Farmers’ Union deputy president, Stuart Roberts, said the new general licences regime must be straightforward, but was happy with the outcome, saying: “It’s encouraging that Defra has taken this on board and the new licences appear to fit within these principles.” Defra declined to give additional comments. Packham is happy that the group is divisive and creates a scene. He says outbursts made by people who disagree means word gets out, adding: “Our change is noisy change, we get a lot of publicity because we’re challenging people, we’re challenging them to uphold the law and to better understand that law and to make sure that it’s implemented.” When you’re asking people who have been doing something unregulated for a long time to change what they’re doing, they will obviously feel it is an injustice, he adds. “They have what we call perceived rights, but those rights are ill-perceived. And if they are illegal, then they must be stopped.” Martin Harper from the RSPB says the group has succeeded in flushing out things that were not right. He thinks the law needs to go further in making people report what birds they have killed. “What they’ve done in a helpful way is to create public debate about what’s tolerable in terms of shooting and killing things, and testing the public’s acceptability of these issues. So I think in that regard – although some might find it disruptive – they’re contributing to a healthy debate about what’s appropriate in the countryside. “The state should welcome that scrutiny and challenge. Is it right for civil society to challenge the government if it believes it is not acting in accordance with the law? Absolutely.” Wild Justice’s tactics are part of a growing movement of organisations created to fight for the environment using legal action. Environmental lawyers ClientEarth sued the UK government for approving a gas-fired power plant because it undermined the government’s commitment to cut greenhouse emissions. The government’s Planning Inspectorate recommended the project was refused because of the climate crisis, although the government later went against this recommendation and gave it the go-ahead. ClientEarth has 169 active cases in more than 50 countries. Trees for Life launched a legal challenge over the Scottish government’s failure to make the killing of beavers a genuine act of last resort when the animals have an unwanted impact on farmland. It has raised £46,000 to support its court challenge, including financial help from Wild Justice. Packham says: “I think that if people see Wild Justice as a model to explore then that’s great. Yes, I would love to be mimicked and plagiarised … we will be very forthcoming in sharing our practice, we are about change and as broad as possible.” “We found a niche and it’s working. We’ll continue to pursue it because sadly there’s no end to the number of cases that we could be taking. It’s just the limitations of the time of the three of us, and that of our lawyers.” Avery says Wild Justice will lose many more challenges than it wins, but will still have an impact because it creates a “landscape of fear” in government agencies, and the sense that they are being watched. Alongside making the public aware of these issues, this could be one of the group’s greatest weapons. He says he has been surprised at their success, adding: “We have no plans to buy slippers and a pipe and sit down quietly and stop causing trouble. I think the world is stuck with us for quite a while.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features  This article was amended on 17 February 2021.

      "Text: Heaven knows, I am used to getting incensed about the killing of predators on grouse moors and pheasant shoots, especially birds of prey, from hen harriers to golden eagles. I am equally outraged by the use of snares, meant mainly to eliminate foxes but agonisingly fatal to any creature that becomes entangled. I could never condone such practices, but I can at least understand the statement of a game keeper who claims he was only obeying his master's orders. However, the report of a large scale annual cull on the Abbeystead grouse moor was something new to me. The targets were not raptors, but lesser black backed gulls. I am afraid one cant resist reflecting on some basic prejudices. Gulls in general seem to be birds that a percentage of the public find it hard to love, accusing them of all sorts of vandalism from pecking toddlers to stealing packed lunches. Add to this with their habits of scavenging on rubbish tips, squitting on cars and – in my part of London – screeching people awake at or before dawn, I fear it isn't surprising that they don't have a huge fan club. It is true that herring gulls are surely less lovable than lesser black backs, but let's face it they have much in common. Except of course that neither species is as common as it used to be, and lessers in particular are declining fast. Ironically, I am old enough to remember when they were a still scarcer bird and with a more romantic lifestyle, in that most of them migrated south for the winter and returned with the spring. I also recall being thrilled to find small flocks beginning to stay through the winter until they merited reclassification as British residents. Alas, it seems that perhaps history is turning full circle, but whatever happens, let it be natural and not the result of anti-gull prejudice, random target practice, or over protection of game birds, many of which are being reared merely to be shot in the name of sport. To borrow from an old bat slogan – gulls need friends.  Bill Oddie is a birdwatcher and broadcaster\n",

      "Text: Labour has attacked the Conservatives over the speed of government efforts to upgrade Britain’s draughty housing stock, as analysis showed a leading household energy efficiency initiative was proceeding at what the party called a “glacial pace”. Just 65,000 homes have been upgraded under the government’s Energy Company Obligation (Eco) scheme since it was relaunched in April last year, according to analysis of statistics released by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ). Labour said this figure was in sharp contrast with the 1.5 million lofts and cavity walls insulated annually before it lost power in 2010. MPs and campaigners have repeatedly urged the government to accelerate the improvement of homes, against the backdrop of the energy and climate crises. Household gas and electricity bills began to soar in late 2021 and the price rises were exacerbated by a spike in wholesale gas costs after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Claire Coutinho, the energy secretary, angered MPs this week when she said that new oil and gas production “wouldn’t necessarily bring energy bills down” in announcing legislation to allow annual licensing rounds for new North Sea projects. Labour’s Alan Whitehead, the shadow energy security minister, said: “It was a stunning admission from this government that, during the worst energy bills crisis in generations, their flagship king’s speech energy policy won’t even take a penny off energy bills. “Now we find that the Conservatives are failing to take any meaningful action to upgrade Britain’s homes – despite the fact that energy efficiency is one of the best ways to cut bills for good. “The Conservatives are so out of touch that they have given up trying to bring down energy bills for British families.” Labour has pledged to devise a “warm homes plan” to give devolved administrations the power and the resources to bring every home in their area up to EPC standard C or higher within a decade. The Eco scheme was first launched in 2013 with the aim of cutting household energy bills by improving household insulation. In the first four years of the scheme, almost 1.7m homes were upgraded. The initiative was relaunched last year, offering support for households to move towards greener heating options, new boilers and cavity wall and loft insulation. A separate scheme, Great British Insulation, was launched in March, designed to help about 300,000 households across the country with the cost of installing new home insulation, and will save consumers about £300 to £400 a year on their bills. However, critics have said the scheme would take 190 years to upgrade the energy efficiency of the UK’s leaky housing stock, and 300 years to meet the government’s own targets to reduce fuel poverty. The DESNZ has been approached for comment.\n",

      "Text: The UK will continue to press governments around the world to cut greenhouse gas emissions urgently in the next year to limit global heating to 1.5C, after the UN climate talks that concluded last week, the president of the summit has pledged. Alok Sharma, the cabinet minister who led the Cop26 talks, said the world had shown in Glasgow that countries could work together to establish a framework for climate action but the next year must focus on keeping the promises made there. “The 1.5C limit lives,” he writes in today’s Guardian. “We brought it back from the brink. But its pulse remains weak. We must steer it to safety by ensuring countries deliver on the promises they have made.” Some argued the talks had failed because the pledges on emissions cuts made at Cop26 were insufficient to meet the 1.5C goal. Sharma acknowledged that countries must increase their pledges and turn them into action and policies. Referring to youth activists from around the world who urged political leaders to act in Glasgow, he said: “We owe it to all of them to deliver what we agreed.” Two weeks of Cop26 talks ended in dramatic fashion as Sharma feared the carefully constructed deal among nearly 200 countries was about to collapse at the last moment, when China and India objected to a reference in the final agreement to the “phase out” of coal-fired power. In the end a compromise was reached, with Sharma on the brink of tears as he apologised to developing countries for the change. The pledges on emissions cuts made at the talks would lead to heating of about 2.4C above pre-industrial levels, far above the 1.5C threshold, so the Glasgow pact also requires countries to revise their targets upwards in the next year. Under the UN rules, the UK will retain responsibility for climate negotiations for the next year, until the Egyptian government assumes the presidency next November. In his first public writing since the talks concluded, Sharma sets out his aims. “The UK’s work as the Cop26 presidency is really only just beginning,” he writes. “Over the course of the next year, we will work with countries urging them to take action and honour their promises. “There is no formal policing process in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change system, and so we must keep up the constructive pressure, and build on the trust and goodwill generated through Cop26.” The lack of any policing process or sanctions for countries that fail to revise their national targets on emissions, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), means that the main ways of holding governments to account are through public scrutiny and political pressure. Australia’s government has already made clear that it does not intend to increase its targets, which are widely regarded as inadequate. The US and the EU have also indicated they do not intend to increase their ambition. Key countries under the spotlight are the world’s biggest emitter, China, whose promise to peak emissions by the end of this decade disappointed many analysts who argued it could go further; and the third biggest emitter, India, which announced new targets in Glasgow but has yet to formally detail them. Russia, Saudi Arabia and Brazil are also under scrutiny. Sharma argues that business and finance will play a key role. “Markets are falling into line, with the value of shares in coal firms around the world dropping since we sent a signal that coal is no longer king,” he writes. Green campaigners have told the Guardian that if the UK wants to show leadership this year, ministers must also look to their own actions. Proposals for a new coalmine in Cumbria, new oil and gas licences in the North Sea, airport and road expansion and dithering on green policy have tarnished the UK’s reputation, while above all the decision to slash overseas aid – even while the Cop26 talks centred on climate finance for poor countries – caused deep alarm. Sharma was widely regarded as isolated within the cabinet at Cop26, as insiders told the Guardian of a rift between the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and prime minister, Boris Johnson, over green measures. Sunak visited the summit briefly but made little impact on senior figures from other countries present. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, also played a little role in Glasgow. Rachel Kyte, a former World Bank top official on climate change, now dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University in the US, told the Guardian that getting other donor countries to increase climate finance “was made even more complicated by UK Treasury’s insistence on cutting overseas aid. While this was then confirmed as being temporary the damage was done ... The UK lost moral authority, and leverage as the presidency which we saw them struggling with. Alok was liked and respected wherever he went but it was not lost on people that he was a little alone [in the cabinet as a champion of climate action]. ” Rachel Kennerley, a climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “The fight to curb climate breakdown didn’t end with Mr Sharma’s gavel coming down on an underwhelming deal. Just next week the high court will hear about UK-financed gas drilling in Mozambique, so this is the perfect time for the government to withdraw support for that damaging project, laden as it is with climate hypocrisy. “Given the UK’s historical contributions to emissions alongside our role as Cop host, it’s right that we take a good look at the fact that we are still supporting fossil fuel extraction, here and overseas.”\n",

      "Text: Australia’s natural renewable energy advantage in the race to create a green hydrogen industry is at risk of being overwhelmed by “huge and aggressive” policy support in the US and the Middle East, according to Fortescue Future Industries’ Guy Debelle. Debelle, formerly FFI’s chief financial officer and now serving as a director, said the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act was mostly aimed at accelerating decarbonisation and was “one of the largest pieces of industrial policy we’ve ever seen”. Without a formal spending cap, it could eventually top $US1trillion ($1.44tn). “It’s not just money,” Debelle told a gathering of business economists in Sydney on Wednesday. “It’s actually people, it’s expertise and knowhow, which [are] migrating to the US.” Oil-rich Middle Eastern nations had also “seen the writing on the wall” of a shift off fossil fuels and were pouring resources and making land available for firms to tap renewable energy resources and develop a hydrogen sector. “There’s a risk that, despite Australia’s great comparative advantages in green energy, the US and the Middle East are going to eat our lunch,” Debelle, who was also formerly a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, said. Many nations are investing heavily in hydrogen as an alternative fuel to oil, gas and coal. Debelle said the US spending had the potential to lower the cost of making hydrogen from $6/kilogram to $2.50/kg. That would be comparable to fossil fuels. One outcome for Australia, if governments didn’t provide “a more targeted response”, was that markets to the north such as Japan and South Korea – which had relatively poor renewable energy resources – would be snapped up by the US or other rivals. “I’m really concerned that we are missing out on a huge opportunity,” he said. Debelle also warned Australian businesses to focus on reducing their greenhouse gas emissions directly, rather than relying on buying carbon offsets to try to cancel them out. Those “misaligned decarbonisation incentives” could leave firms vulnerable to higher costs as carbon credits “will get more expensive”, he said. Future market restrictions, such as from the European Union, could also leave them vulnerable if they had not cut emissions. “I’m concerned about people waiting for long … and that means we don’t get the nascent industry off the ground here,” Debelle said, adding he could foresee companies scrambling to find alternatives “but the solutions take three or four years to build”. In Australia, scale could determine which localities succeeded in fostering a hydrogen industry. Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia were more likely to have the size for exports, given their solar and wind resources. States such as NSW, though, had the scope to supply local industries. Fortescue Future Industries, for instance, was working with AGL Energy to repurpose its Liddell coal-fired power station after it shuts completely by April. “The grid’s already set up,” Debelle said, explaining the Hunter Valley plant’s appeal. Paul Barrett, chief executive for Hysata, a company developing electrolysis cells based on University of Wollongong research, said the US support included $US1bn for hydrogen electroliser production in an infrastructure bill. “We could really be left behind in the race to net zero” emissions by 2050, he said. Still, with ample renewable energy and land, a long coastline and access to key minerals from iron ore to lithium, Australia was well-placed to be competitive. “We truly are the lucky country,” Barrett said. Hysata, meanwhile, was “ahead of plans” reported by Guardian Australia last year in its bid to produce electrolysis with a 95% efficiency. The devices use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The company is able to produce a kilogram with 41.5 kilowatt-hours of electricity, about 20% better than the industry standard of about 52KWh/kg, Barrett said.\n",

      "Text: While it is good news for the environment that UK sales of electric cars are rising (Report, 7 February) this trend is unlikely to really take off while we have such a disjointed and shortsighted policy regarding electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. Boris Johnson sold the London-wide charging network to a French company that now runs the system as Source London. It has started to charge for charging, at rates that are unviable for many drivers, especially those with hybrid vehicles, where the cost of the electricity is more than the cost of petrol for the same mileage travelled. Furthermore, some London councils now make their own arrangements with other providers so there is no longer a functioning London-wide system. Add to that the various private pay-to-charge networks across the country and you have a complete dog’s breakfast of a system, requiring multiple memberships, cards and different charging rates. Planners are requiring developers to install charging points with no thought about the value these facilities will bring to real drivers – in Enfield there is a furniture store on a retail park with 12 charging points operating on a pay-to-charge network. Bear in mind it can take four hours to charge, so who, apart from the staff working in the store, will ever make any real use of these facilities? Electric cars make sense where you can install your own charging point at home, though in cities many people do not have driveways or garages, so cannot do this. EV drivers can help make substantial reductions in carbon emissions. They have usually paid more for their vehicles and some have received tax breaks for buying them through company schemes. All these benefits will be lost if we allow the charging infrastructure to be fragmented and hobbled by charging rates that make it not worthwhile to charge.Alan GavurinLondon  Academic research suggests that, in geological terms, fracking for shale gas in Scotland will be economically marginal at best (Scottish government launches public consultation on fracking, theguardian.com, 1 February). Comprehensive data for 25 US shale-gas systems has recently been made available, detailing their geochemical, rock physics, and production decline. The information allows a geostatistical analysis of gas yield and comparison with other regions. I find Scottish shales to be below the thermal maturity needed for effective gas generation, at low reservoir pressures and so geologically faulted that they do not provide a match with even the poorest of the US systems. The deeper, structurally simpler and higher carbon content shales in the north of England seem to have more potential. If current hydrocarbon exploration in Lancashire and Yorkshire turns out to be unsuccessful, or cost-effectively borderline, then that would provide the clearest of signals that a US-style shale gas industry is an extremely unlikely outcome for Scotland. Hence, the best response to Holyrood would be to suggest that the government await developments south of the border.Roy ThompsonEmeritus professor of geosciences, Edinburgh University  Adam Vaughan’s excellent report on electricity sources (Wind and solar take strain to keep UK lights on, 7 February) identifies the importance of reducing demand when the system has difficulty meeting such demand. Duncan Burt of National Grid is quoted as saying that the answer is to persuade big industrial and commercial interests to shift their demand at these times. However, domestic users could also make a big contribution if a real-time electricity tariff is introduced which varies with the spot price. Some reduction would be due to human decisions, but, over time, a bigger contribution would be from automatic smart products, developed to adjust their usage.

      "Text: US efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions look set for a huge boost this year, with carbon pollution from the power sector set to fall to its lowest level since 1994. Record numbers of US coal-fired power plants are set to close this year, and analysts at Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) say this will likely see power sector emissions drop 15.4% below 2005 levels. Research published today indicates 23GW, 7% of US coal capacity, will come offline due to a combination of low gas prices, new mercury emission standards and the age of closing power plants. “On an emissions rate basis (t/MWh), 2015 will be the cleanest year in over 60 years for which we have historical data,” says the report. At the same time investment in renewables is rising fast, with a new 18 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy due to starting feeding into the US grid this year. BNEF says new solar installations will hit an “all-time high” of 9.1GW, led by California, while new wind build will hit 8.8GW, with a third of new projects in Texas. “More interesting than the single-year drop in emissions are the ‘structural’ impacts that will live on for decades,” said BNEF’s William Nelson, head of north american analysis. “Emissions can rise or fall year-to-year based on weather anomalies and volatile fuel prices – but in 2015, we’ll take a giant, permanent step towards decarbonizing our entire fleet of power plants.” Cutting its use of coal is a one of the main strategies in the Obama administration’s domestic and international efforts to address climate change. The US has a 2020 goal of curbing greenhouse gas emissions 17% on 2005 levels, and a 2030 target recently submitted to the UN of 28% cuts on 2005 levels. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2014 38% of US energy-related CO2 emissions came from the power generation sector. Of that 76% of emissions were from coal, with 22% from gas. The US coal power sector is set to face further restrictions once the Environmental Protection Agency’s clean power plan is finalized later this year. The EPA says it will help cut CO2 emissions from the power sector 30% on 2005 levels. The law is set to rule out the use of all but the most efficient coal plants. Critics in the Republican party say they will try and block the new legislation, which is being enforced under the existing Clean Air Act. Lead Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, who represents a staunch coal-mining constituency, has written to federal states suggesting they refuse to comply with the rules. Meanwhile, the two Republicans to have declared they will run for the 2016 presidency – Ted Cruz and Rand Paul – have both expressed doubts over the veracity of climate science. Separately, the charitable arm of ex New York mayor Michael Bloomberg’s business holdings has announced it will invest an extra $30m in efforts to replace half the US coal fleet with clean energy alternatives by 2017. The funds, which will be directed into the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign, aim to back what Michael Bloomberg says is US leadership among industrialised countries in ditching fossil fuels. “Thanks to the community leaders who have spearheaded this work, the U.S. led every industrialized nation in reducing carbon emissions last year,” he said. “But much more work remains, and today we are doubling down on what has proven to be an incredibly successful strategy for improving public health and fighting climate change.” According to the Sierra Club, every 50GW of coal power removed from the grid prevents more than 3,600 deaths and 60,000 asthma attacks, saving $2.3 billion in health care costs every year. Earlier this week the White House launched its own health and climate drive, warning that rising temperatures would lead to more smog, allergies and deaths among vulnerable members of the community. It argued the new clean power plan would offer US$55-93 billion in “annual net benefits” from reducing pollution levels.\n",

      "Text: Seventy years ago, London was brought to a halt by a thick smog that blanketed the city. It is difficult to imagine how it must have felt to be indoors with fog pressed against the windows. People who ventured outside could not see their feet and many got lost in their own neighbourhoods. The smog began on 5 December 1952, a Friday. Weekend football was cancelled because players could not see across the pitch. Theatres closed as the smog crept inside and audiences could no longer see the stage. Hundreds of people became ill. Ambulances crawled around the city taking patients to overcrowded hospitals. Many of those admitted died within hours. Others went to bed at home and died in their sleep. By Monday morning, mortuaries were full. The smog lasted for nearly a week and led to the deaths of about 12,000 Londoners, a disaster greater than the worst cholera outbreaks of the 1800s. This may seem like distant history but lessons from the smog are still relevant. Delay and inaction on air pollution costs lives then and it does now. It took four years for a reluctant government to pass the Clean Air Act of 1956 and, as a consequence, several thousand Londoners died in smogs through the 1950s and early 60s. Burning solid fuels is a very polluting way to heat your home, especially in open fires. In the 50s, 18% of UK coal was used for home heating but this produced 60% of our wintertime smoke pollution. Even today, the 8% of UK homes that burn wood produce more particle pollution than the exhaust from all our road vehicles. Seemingly intractable air pollution problems can be addressed if there is sufficient political will. Some dismiss the success of China’s air pollution controls as only being possible because of its political system, but smoke pollution in London reduced by about 70% in the decade after the 1956 act, easily equalling modern Beijing’s achievements. We cannot tackle air pollution piecemeal, focusing on one pollutant or source and ignoring others. The narrow focus on smoke control in the 50s and 60s allowed sulphur pollution from coal and oil use to grow across the UK and Europe. This led to the acid rain that devastated Scandinavia’s lakes and forests in the 70s and 80s. We then focused on industrial pollution but allowed transport pollution to grow with few controls. Today traffic exhaust is the main topic of debate but we risk another 70 years of air pollution harm if we continue to overlook other sources. In the UK, these include air pollution from agriculture, the growing problems from solvents and personal care products, the resurgence in wood and coal heating and the pollution particles from the wear of brakes, tyres and roads that contaminate our air and rivers. Solving air pollution is an opportunity to remove a health burden of at least 28,000 deaths annually in the UK and more than 4 million across the globe. If we get it right, reducing air pollution can help our climate emergency too.\n",

      "Text: Ben Green doesn’t have to worry that Vladimir Putin might cut off Europe’s gas this winter, fret about a seasonal revival of Covid-19, or panic about a looming global food crisis. Green weaned himself off gas when he purchased the five-hectare (12-acre) grounds of a derelict East German army barracks three years ago: the previous owner, who used it as an outdoor museum for vintage tanks, had gutted the building of water and gas pipes. Green patched up the roof of the refectory and insulated the windows so that temperatures inside don’t drop below 5C at night. He bathes by pouring a bucket of cold water over his head and cooks on a wood-burning stove. A 49-year-old Englishman with a greying ginger beard and the word “Vegan!” tattooed on his left upper arm, Green is unaffected by fraying supply chains because he lives almost entirely off the vegetables and fruit he grows on his land. If, as Green hopes, friends give him an oil press for his 50th birthday, he will soon be able to cut out the occasional four-mile cycle to the nearest village for cooking oil. On those trips he does stock up on tea, coffee and chocolate, but they are luxuries he could dispense with in the case of a systemic breakdown of supply chains. The fact his food miles are still measurable at all is due to the bottomless appetite of Fat Tony, Brunhilde Demagogue and Marilyn Monroe, his three Mangalica pigs. Coronavirus is not a cause for concern – partly because Green is twice vaccinated, in spite of one what one may assume from his enthusiasm for herbal remedies, but mainly because he lives on his own in the middle of a remote spruce forest in Saxony, whose exact coordinates he keeps secret, and rarely receives visitors. Green does worry about this year’s extreme heat and drought, which is endangering his race to fill his cellar with 100 pots of tomato stew, 180kg of potatoes and 22kg of dried beans in order to survive the winter. But this summer’s soaring temperatures may also lead more people to recognise Green’s experiment in self-sufficiency as a model to emulate in preparation for a climate catastrophe. A catastrophe, Green believes, which is inevitable and imminent. “When I was born, we were at 324 parts of carbon dioxide in one million parts of air. This year, we hit 420. Change is coming, and if you’re not prepared for it, it’s going to be fairly awful. “What we are looking at isn’t the end of humanity but the end of capitalism,” he said, describing climate breakdown as the common denominator behind the various political, food, energy and health crises that have started to converge in recent years. “The collapse is going to happen, and this is the year when people will notice.” Living in expectation of the apocalypse is no longer a minority position. A YouGov survey carried out at the start of the coronavirus pandemic found almost a third of respondents in the US anticipate a life-changing disaster in their lifetime. A separate poll of five countries in 2019 found that more than half of respondents in France, Italy, the UK and the US think civilisation as they know it will collapse in years to come. In America, anxiety about a systemic breakdown has fed a trend of “preppers” stocking up on food supplies and arms to look after themselves and their families. During the pandemic, US sellers of underground shelters reported surging demand. Green, who chronicles his hermit existence on his Instagram account, The Pirate Ben, sees himself in the vanguard of a more positive and less selfish European counter-movement: “happy doomerism”. “The problem with preppers is: what do they do when the baked beans run out? I don’t want any fear here – that’s where all the white power stuff comes from.” He doesn’t believe in the need for population reduction, as do some on the fringes where the far right and eco-activism overlap. If people can keep or relearn their knowledge of how to sustainably work the land, Green argues, there should be enough food for everyone: “What I am trying to do is preserve the best of our society for when we come out at the other end.” There is more of The Good Life than Extinction Rebellion to his decision to rescue his pigs from a butcher – an act of “effective altruism” the three huge pigs are evidently unwilling to repay. Their never-ending hunger for horse muesli mixed with hay pellets, and stale bread rolls from the nearest village bakery, is what still stops him from living a 100% self-sufficient and climate-neutral existence. “The pigs were the worst decision in my life,” he said, as he gives Tony a doting pat on his muddied back. “It was stupid, and clearly detrimental to my goals.” Eating them would be the logical conclusion, he admits. “But it’s not going to happen.” To call Green a humanist would be one step too far, he said. Building a self-sufficient post-climate change community requires discipline: he rises at 6am, feeds the pigs, tends to his crops, mows grass, feeds the pigs a second time, and then goes to bed at around 10pm. And such discipline requires a strong belief in right and wrong. He places the blame for climate change not just with a few powerful individuals, he wrote on one recent blog entry, but all of those who participated in a world-destroying economy: “Every person who works for a fossil fuel company in any capacity should be tried for genocide. From the kids in the post-room to the CEOs.” Green reiterated the point when asked about the blog entry. “A few show trials for genocide would go a hell of a long way.” What would be the punishment for genocide? “I think that’s fairly well established.” Before he moved to the barracks in the Saxon woods three years ago, the native Brummie pursued a successful career as an IT engineer. Spells in Austria, Spain, London and Berlin ended when he was fired from his last job in Zurich in 2018. With the severance payment and his savings, he bought the former barracks of the East German National People’s Army. Though he speaks fluent German, the choice of location was the result of a rational cost-benefit analysis rather than any strong affection for the eastern German state bordering the Czech Republic. “You want to be as far north as you can be for the heat, but also as far south as you can be because of the sunlight for the growing season.” Seekers of self-sufficient lifestyles setting up communes in Spain or Portugal, he said, were “insane” because they would struggle to work the land amid rising temperatures. Preppers look after themselves. Green wants to set an example for others to follow, but for now happy doomerism remains a movement of one. After starting out with occasional volunteers who helped him work the land, he currently runs the project solo. A strict no-drugs policy at the barracks is designed to put off half-hearted dropouts. “The first follower will have to be very special,” he said, sitting down in the refectory to escape the midday sun. “They will have to believe in the project in the way even I don’t.” Anyone seriously interested in joining Green in the event of a climate-induced famine can pay €3,500 (£2,950) to be put on a waiting list, though he gives no guarantees that will automatically secure a place. One person has already made the payment.\n",

      "Text: A small bird once so abundant it was called “the Pennine finch” is teetering on the brink of extinction in England after just 12 pairs bred this summer. The twite, an inconspicuous, seed-eating bird that nests in the uplands and spends winters on coastal marshes, has suffered a precipitous decline this century, with the breeding population falling by 75% between 1999 and 2013. Despite a rescue effort led by Natural England and the RSPB, in which hill farmers have been paid to plant “twite meadows” filled with wildflowers that produce the bird’s favourite foods, the bird has continued to decline, falling by another 75% since 2016. “The way we’re going, we think it will be locally extinct within the next three to five years,” said Katie Aspin, the RSPB’s twite recovery project officer. Reasons for the bird’s disappearance include less wild seed in upland meadows, climate change and the loss of tall heather in uplands, resulting in twite nesting in bracken where they appear to be more easily preyed on by stoats and weasels. The genetic diversity and resilience of English twites may also have lessened because the population is now so small it no longer flies overseas in winter and mixes with birds from other countries, such as Norway. “The key reason for this decline is the poor availability of food during the breeding season because of the loss of species-rich hay meadows and pasture in upland England because of agricultural intensification,” said Aspin. The twite recovery project has concentrated efforts on the remaining birds breeding in a triangle of uplands between Manchester, Leeds and Halifax. Farmers have been paid through agri-environment schemes to cut hay later in the year, allowing flowers to seed and provide more food for the birds. More than 250 hectares (618 acres) of twite meadows have also been planted with dandelion, common sorrel and autumn hawkbit to provide food in the breeding season. This summer, 15 supplementary feeding stations also supplied the twite with niger seed. The twite is one of only two birds in Britain that feed on seeds all year round. Most seed-eating species resort to feeding on protein-rich insects when they are rearing young. Each surviving English twite is given a colour ring so it can be individually identified and monitored in a project led by Jamie Dunning, a conservation scientist at Imperial College London. “The age-old story of massive changes to the way we farm the land is probably the main cause but we suspect there’s some aspect of climate change going on here as well,” said Dunning. The bird is at the southern edge of its range in England. According to Dunning, a few twite have nested on the cliffs of limestone quarries but have then been disturbed by the quarrying. In their core area of the south Pennines, large areas of grouse moor are also unsuitable for the birds because the moors are burnt and the heather is not allowed to grow tall enough for twite to nest in it. Researchers also fear that twite may be further hit by lower food availability in the winter, which English twite usually spend on salt marshes along the east coast. While there is a small Scottish population of twite, conservation scientists are warning that it is experiencing similar declines, and Britain’s unique subspecies of twite could be at risk of complete extinction. “Scotland is our last chance to protect the population here which is a unique subspecies,” said Dunning. “It’s about learning lessons now to protect the populations that exist further north.” But the twite, whose scientific name, Linaria flavirostris, means “resembling linen”, may also have suffered because it is a species that has slipped from collective consciousness and even birdwatchers don’t really know about it. “You talk to people and they say, what on earth is a twite?” said Aspin. “Raising awareness is important so people know what it is and know what is happening. In the past it was called the Pennine finch. Everybody knew what it was back then.”\n",

      "Text: Keir Starmer has challenged the oil industry to dramatically speed up its shift to clean energy by offering up to £2.5bn to subsidise new jobs in renewables for North Sea workers. The Labour leader has told executives from firms including Shell and BP that the UK is in a global race to move away from oil and gas, with competitor countries such as the US investing billions in climate-friendly technologies. Starmer and Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, hosted a roundtable with executives from 20 energy firms in Aberdeen on Thursday during a two-day visit to promote the party’s plans to decarbonise UK energy supplies by 2030 – a target date the oil industry is vigorously resisting. Starmer will announce on Friday that if Labour wins the next election, it would set up a £2.5bn “British jobs bonus” fund to prioritise investment in three clean energy technologies, in regions heavily dependent on North Sea oil, including around Aberdeen and north-east England. The technologies would be: carbon capture to support industries that still need oil and gas to pipe their waste CO2 into depleted North Sea oilfields; building floating windfarms for deep-water sites; and in green hydrogen – a zero carbon fuel needed for energy-intensive industries such as steelmaking, railways and chemicals production. Starmer argues that Rishi Sunak’s recent decision to “max out” the North Sea’s oil and gas production and deprioritise green energy and technology investment is a strategic failure driven by the belief it will increase the Conservatives’ short-term electoral support, particularly in north-east Scotland. “This Conservative party has zero ambition, zero plan and zero concern for the millions of British families suffering sky-high energy bills as a result of the government’s abject failure,” the Labour leader said. “Every day that they play political games, causing uncertainty and investment risk for the sector, they are costing jobs and hitting people’s pockets. My Labour government will rise above short-termist gimmicks, put the country before our party, and deliver the long-term future of our energy industry.” The oil industry lobbying group Offshore Energy UK (OEUK) says it is committed to a long-term transition to net zero but has embraced Sunak’s decision to license extraction in the Rosebank oil and gas field, the North Sea’s largest untapped field. OEUK is pressing the government to support another £100bn in new North Sea investments, to replace the 180 fields it predicts will stop producing oil in the next decade. Climate scientists are adamant that doing so will sabotage global efforts to prevent runaway climate heating. Starmer is understood to have argued in the roundtable that while oil and gas will still play a role in UK energy supply, a partnership was required between industry, unions and government to shift quickly on to zero-carbon technologies. Labour has promised the £2.5bn jobs subsidy and other funding streams would support “historic energy communities” across the UK, including Grangemouth, a sprawling oil and petrochemical complex on the Firth of Forth. It also plans to invest in upgrading major ports around the UK, arguing that is a far wiser strategic investment than the freeports Sunak has vowed to create. Starmer’s engagement with oil executives carries political risks but also recognises the significance of persuading the industry to accept the case for rapidly meeting the UK’s net zero targets, both for the general election and meeting Labour’s manifesto commitments. Sunak has made clear he plans to frame Labour’s approach as a “war on motorists” and will accuse Starmer of destroying valuable North Sea jobs. Labour hopes voters, union leaders and oil workers will accept the urgency of the climate argument, and that Starmer’s strategy will also help it outflank the Scottish National party at the next election. Floating offshore windfarms will provide much cheaper clean electricity but there are substantial reservations about how significant a role carbon capture and mass-produced hydrogen can play in the clean energy transition.\n",

      "Text: A dusty construction site on the edge of an Arabian desert is an unlikely place for a model of green living. But this is Masdar City, an $18bn (£11bn) Norman Foster-designed project where just a few hundred people are guinea pigs in the world's most advanced laboratory for hi-tech environmental technology. Here, residents live with driverless electric cars, shaded streets cooled by a huge wind tower and a Big Brother-style \"green policeman\" monitoring their energy use. Conceived in 2006, phase one of the city is now complete after three years' work and a spend of $1.4bn. The development, near Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, consists of six main buildings, one street, 101 small apartments, a large electronic library, and the Masdar Institute. This offshoot campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has 167 students and 43 academics, most of whom are from other countries, the US, Europe, Asia and elsewhere in the Middle East. On campus there is a bank, a sushi bar, canteen, organic food shop and a concrete basement where 10 driverless vehicles whiz people along the 800 metres from the entrance of the city to the institute. Here are some of Masdar City's other features. The 45-metre Teflon-coated wind tower shows citizens how much energy the community is using; argon gas insulates the rammed earth and steel walls; solar air-conditioning and desalination plants are being tested, as are thermal energy and \"beam down\" solar plants that use mirrors to concentrate the sun and heat water to generate electricity. Phase two, due to be finished this year, will add 222 more apartments, and more streets and shops. An $800m HQ, which will house the new International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), should be finished by 2013. By 2015, Masdar City is expected to have 7,000 residents and 12,000 people commuting from Abu Dhabi. \"It felt like culture shock,\" Laura Stupin, a young American engineer and one of the first inhabitants of the city, wrote on her blog. \"The buildings are beautiful here, and they look so different from anything I've ever seen, anywhere. I keep telling people that it feels like I'm living in a psychology experiment. Every time I flip a light switch in the living room and the faucet in the bathroom starts running, or I desperately push all the buttons on the stove to try to turn on a burner, I can't help looking over my shoulder and wondering if there's a scientist observing my behaviour and reactions in this strange environment.\" That's because of the monitors, which analyse every human and mechanical action requiring electricity. Every machine the students use, every fridge door they open, or light they leave on, is recorded via an intelligent digital grid that senses and controls energy use and lets the power provider intervene. Showers turn off after a few minutes, sensors switch on fridges and lights. Temperature and water use can be centrally controlled. \"The city is a laboratory for the future,\" says Martyn Potter, director of operations at the institute and dubbed the \"green policeman\". The Big Brother approach to cutting energy is likely to become the norm as computerised smart grids are rolled out in Europe and the US, he adds. \"I want to know exactly how these buildings work. I can pinpoint who is using most energy and water, whether in an apartment or the academy. Certain students have been used to having the air conditioning on at 16C (61F), here it is 24C. Yes, they complain. But I have told them that's how it is.\" Fred Moavenzadeh, head of the institute, and a Harvard professor, says: \"The shock of having to conserve energy is part of the Masdar human experiment. We are living and experiencing what we are trying to … educate people about … We're using roughly half the energy of a normal building of this size. We are producing no carbon because it's all renewable. Our water consumption is less and our waste generation is relatively low.\" The plan was to make Masdar the world's first zero-carbon city, but as the global \"cleantech\" market stalls in the recession, compromises are made. Foster planned to accommodate 50,000 residents and 40,000 commuters and the city was due be completed by 2016; now the final population will probably not exceed 40,000 and the completion date has been put at 2021 or 2025. The idea of a second Masdar City has been dropped; a $2.2bn hydrogen power project has been called off, as has a \"thin film\" solar manufacturing plant, intended for Abu Dhabi. \"The Masdar master plan is changing as the world economy changes,\" says Dale Rollins, a former Shell executive, now Masdar's chief operating officer. \"It's unfair to say that what was decided in 2006 will hold for ever more. The objectives have not changed but we have re-worked the master plan. The technology and the market has moved on. We say we can do it better and we can do it in less expensive ways.\" Foster's vision was for Masdar's streets to be pedestrian-only with pilotless vehicles running via magnets and fibre-optic cables. But this is now thought a white elephant. The rest of the city will be built on one floor, saving hundreds of millions of pounds. And people might move about in \"golf buggy\" taxis. The master plan was to desalinate groundwater with solar energy, but for now water is piped in from one of Abu Dhabi's gas-fired, high-energy, desalination plants. The revised plan no longer counts on-site energy generation as the only source of power. The idea of coveringA scheme for covering all roofs with solar panels was found to be more costly than a centralised power plant. Meanwhile, the photovoltaic panels outside the city are proving less efficient than expected because of dust storms and haze, which can cut solar insolation by 30% – the panels must be cleaned by hand. People living in the city say they quickly get used to the technology but not the setting. \"It's quite a mind flip to be in such a strangely beautiful environment, then look out of a window and see flat dusty landscape stretching out to the horizon. It makes me feel like I'm living in a science fiction novel,\" wrote Stupin.\n",

      "Text: The Morrison government has been promising a “gas-fired recovery” from the pandemic since not long after lockdowns began in early 2020. Over the past 18 months it has announced nearly $1bn in funding for gas projects. But this has done almost nothing to aid the country’s recovery from the Covid recession for an obvious reason – gas power plants, pipelines and basins take years to develop and build. Further, as Greg Jericho has pointed out, the gas industry employs very few people. The Coalition is laying the foundation for a long-term expansion of a fossil fuel industry – in some cases with Labor’s support. The government is betting this decades-long, big-emitting infrastructure will remain viable while Australia, and much of the world, is promising to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Angus Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, this week announced another $50.3m to support companies developing seven gas and carbon capture and storage projects. He said they were priorities under the government’s gas-fired recovery and the country had to make sure it had “adequate supply and storage to avoid expected shortfalls in production in southern Australia that could emerge by 2024”. In a speech to gas industry representatives, the minister said the “energy crisis in Europe” – exacerbated by Russia’s attack on Ukraine – “should act as a warning of what could happen in Australia if there is not enough investment in the gas sector here”. He made a similar point on social media. No. Putting aside whether it is in good taste to compare Australia’s situation with what’s facing countries currently affected by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, let’s briefly consider what has happened in Europe. Russia is a major fossil fuel exporter and has been providing the continent with up to 40% of its gas. For Germany, it’s 60%. European powers have been understandably criticised for allowing themselves to become increasingly reliant on Russia for energy while Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian regime has been taking documented steps to undermine global security and stability – and threatening to invade its neighbour. Energy prices in Europe spiked after the invasion but were already high due in significant part to gas shortages linked to Russia not increasing supply. Figures vary across the continent, but according to some estimates, gas prices are up about 65% and electricity 30% on average over the past year. As Taylor said, bills have skyrocketed, hurting households and shuttering businesses. National governments have been scrambling for alternative supplies. In some countries, but not all, the supply crisis has renewed talk about the need to accelerate the shift to renewable energy. Energy security and independence are live issues. The situation in Australia is markedly different. It already has energy independence thanks to its access to vast supplies of sun, wind, coal and gas. It just has to make decisions about how to use them. Australia does not have a gas shortage. It extracts more gas than it needs to meet domestic demand – many times over – but sells three-quarters overseas as LNG (liquefied natural gas). This has made sense for fossil fuel producers, which reaped the financial benefits, but led to a sharp spike in the cost of gas for Australian consumers as the international market set, and inflated, the domestic price. Successive governments have allowed this to happen, and some LNG is tied up in long-term contracts – but there is no shortfall in what Australia produces. This is disputed. The amount of gas available from existing reservoirs in Victoria, in particular, is declining, and the state is more reliant on gas than other jurisdictions due to it being piped into homes for heating and cooking. Even with a concerted effort, it would take time to shut down that network and convert to clean electricity. But experts say the crunch may not hit as soon as 2024, and there are better ways to ensure people get what they need than by spending hundreds of millions of dollars locking in more of an expensive fuel that contributes to global heating. Tony Wood, from the Grattan Institute, believes the most sensible approach would be to set up a short-term gas import terminal in Victoria to supply it from existing fields in Western Australia, rather than the Coalition’s approach of investing in infrastructure that could take a decade to build and would soon be a “white elephant” as the push for cleaner solutions accelerates. There is an economic argument for a swift transition away from domestic gas use. Saul Griffith, an Australian who advised the US government on energy policy, last year estimated converting all home appliances and cars to run on clean electricity could eliminate a third of Australia’s emissions while saving households $40bn a year by 2028. This sort of plan to “electrify everything” would allow existing gas supplies to be used to meet demand in the few manufacturing industries in which there are currently no affordable alternatives. The Grattan Institute has estimated that fewer than 1% of Australian manufacturing jobs are in gas-intensive industries that would materially benefit from an industry expansion. Climate change was not mentioned in Taylor’s speech on Tuesday to the Australian domestic gas outlook conference in Sydney where he announced the new funding. The government’s position over time has been that gas is part of the solution to reduce emissions, both here and overseas, because it displaces coal and can back up renewable energy. But the head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, last year warned countries could not open new oil and gas fields if they were to keep alive a chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – a goal that was acknowledged and strengthened in last year’s Glasgow climate pact. Gas is often said to have about half the emissions of coal when burned, but several studies have suggested its actual impact is higher than that, due to leakage of methane – a particularly potent greenhouse gas – during extraction and transport. Scientists have warned cutting methane emissions will be vital if 1.5C is to stay within reach. The US and EU last year led a group of countries that signed up to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030. Australia declined to join them. The Morrison government’s stance has been regularly noticed and noted by global leaders – most recently by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, who this week singled out Australia as a “hold out” for refusing to commit to meaningful emissions reduction targets by 2030, as scientists say is necessary.\n",

      "Text: The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, will be seeking assurances from the UK that there will be no reneging on climate promises, after Rishi Sunak’s rowing back on green measures. The UN is concerned that countries may be backsliding on pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions sharply, to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Top UN officials called for countries to put aside geopolitical tensions in order to make progress on tackling the climate crisis at the crucial Cop28 climate summit in Dubai, which begins on 30 November. Amina Mohammed, deputy secretary general, said the UN was “absolutely” concerned about backsliding on climate commitments because “there is a lot of it”. Countries made pledges last year, at the Cop27 summit in Egypt, and at the landmark Cop26 summit in Glasgow in 2021, where the 1.5C limit was strongly affirmed. Many countries have since appeared to waver, through expanding fossil fuel access after the invasion of Ukraine, or by failing to set strong targets. In the UK, the prime minister has said the legally binding target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 still stands, but recent actions, such as postponing the phase-out of petrol driven cars and gas boilers, make it doubtful the UK will meet its emissions reduction commitments for 2030. In the US, Joe Biden has licensed new oil and gas developments, despite taking a strong stance on the climate crisis. The EU has also recently failed to toughen its commitment to emissions reduction, currently set at a 55% cut by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, and China and India continue to invest in coal. “Certainly, the secretary general will be leaning in to have those conversations with countries like the UK, the US, China, many [others]. It doesn’t stop,” Mohammed told the Guardian. “We have to keep them in the room [discussing climate action]. We need to get out of everyone the best of the ambition that is expected from us.” She said backsliding was a problem. “We have to call that out and it has to reverse itself. There is a lot of it. And this is what brings more mistrust into the room, that suddenly the goalposts may be changing.” Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the UN’s top climate official, said in the same interview: “Those [countries] who have the ability to go further, fastest [on cutting emissions] must, and those that can, that aren’t – I think they’re already being called out.” The Cop28 meeting will take place at a time of rising global tensions over the Israel-Hamas war and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Mohammed said the climate summit was happening “in very difficult times”, but called on countries to put these tensions aside for the two-week Dubai meeting. “[We need] the signals that come from ministers, to give negotiators a green light to bring ambition into this and find solutions. It’s very easy not to find the solutions and to get lost in the geopolitical tensions that are around. But if we could get leadership [from heads of government], we could probably get a lot done,” she said. Stiell added: “We know what needs to be done, we know how it needs to be done. It does boil down to this well-worn phrase of the political will to actually action the elements that are on the table, that are being negotiated right now. It’s turning those words to action, and it’s incumbent on every minister that will be participating in Cop28 and every head of state.” He said countries must reduce emissions far faster: “Parties cannot wait, the science tells us that very clearly. They are moving too slowly.” Sunak will face a difficult summit at Cop28, given doubts over the UK’s commitments. King Charles is to make a keynote address to the summit, at the request of the hosts. He takes a keen interest in the climate talks, and hosted the Cop28 president, Sultan Al Jaber, at a public reception and private meeting in Buckingham Palace earlier this year. Claire Coutinho, the UK’s energy security and net zero secretary, will attend Cop28, the government confirmed. She said: “No major economy has cut emissions faster than the UK. We’re proud that we’ve overdelivered on every target to cut our emissions to date. “However, tackling climate change is a global challenge, as the UK only accounts for 1% of worldwide emissions. I look forward to representing the UK at Cop28, where we will be working to get more progress around the world on green finance, forests, and clean energy. In the UK, we have more ambitious climate change targets than our peers and we will be using what we have learned to help others on our shared path to net zero.”\n",

      "Text: The UK's largest coal-fired power station could be turned into one of its biggest sources of renewable energy – if subsidies are increased. Drax generated about 6% of the UK's total renewable power in the first half of this year, through burning straw and other biomass at its Yorkshire power station. This was achieved despite burning a much lower proportion of biomass than the plant could sustain if run under optimal conditions. Dorothy Thompson, chief executive of Drax, said the power station could be transformed to produce more renewable energy than fossil fuel power, using biomass from straw, waste wood and other sources instead of coal. Biomass is a relatively green fuel because the materials from which it is made have absorbed carbon dioxide from the air as they grow. With higher levels of biomass burning, Drax and other coal-fired power stations could have a lower carbon footprint than gas-fired power stations, according to the company. The government is promoting gas as the \"greener\" alternative to coal as ministers struggle with the need to address the potential for power shortages at the same time as cutting carbon dioxide emissions. But Thompson said her vision would only come about if the government increased the subsidies to biomass, which are paid for through consumers' power bills, to a level more comparable with other sources of renewable energy generation. Under current conditions, Thompson said, it was uneconomic to burn biomass, and at present biomass generation at Drax runs at about 8%, compared with more than 50% which the company believes to be possible. \"The level of financial support is inadequate to burn biomass in very large quantities at current market rates,\" she said. She said moving to majority biomass generation could be a relatively quick process, if the company was given the green light by ministers. \"We would see ourselves starting along this path immediately, with delivery within three to four years,\" she said. \"By 2020, we could be delivering renewable energy to more than 2m homes.\" Currently, biomass generation is awarded half of a \"renewable energy obligation certificate\" (ROC) per unit of electricity, compared with two ROCs for each unit of offshore wind. The government is scheduled to decide on this issue soon, with a view to bringing in draft legislation by the end of this year, but may miss the deadline. Drax has already put on hold planned investments in new biomass-only power plants, because the company believes they would be uneconomic under current rules. But Thompson said that the carbon floor price the government is planning to introduce would erode the competitiveness of coal-fired generation in the future. Whether or not this would result in a reduction of coal use in the UK, however, would depend on the future price of gas. Chris Huhne, secretary of state for energy and climate change, said: \"Biomass is one of the cheapest ways of meeting our renewable energy targets, but the key issue is setting the level of support – enough to deliver what is needed, but not too much or that becomes an unnecessary price for the end user to pay.\" He said the current review of subsidy levels and government consultation would be completed later in the year. Drax, which presented its half-year results on Tuesday, was boosted by a one-off tax credit of £198m during the period, following the resolution of a complex tax dispute. The company said the money could provide \"a very important part\" of the hundreds of millions of pounds in investment needed to convert its current coal-fired boilers to predominantly biomass generation. Tests at the plant have shown that burning more than 50% biomass in its boilers is technically feasible, if certain adjustments are made. Thompson also argues that biomass can be complementary to intermittent sources of renewable energy such as wind power, acting as back-up generation if the wind fails to blow. Drax, which reported a pre-tax profit of £169m, also said it had refinanced its debt facilities to April 2014. The company returned an interim dividend of 16p a share.\n",

      "Text: Malcolm Turnbull should encourage Australia’s battery energy storage industry now he has “taken interest in the tweets of an American billionaire”, Zen Energy chairman Ross Garnaut says. Garnaut was referring to Elon Musk, the billionaire co-founder of electric car giant Tesla, who tweeted that Tesla could solve the power shortage issue causing price spikes and blackouts in South Australia within 100 days by installing 100-300 megawatt hours of battery storage. Turnbull subsequently tweeted that he had phoned Musk and enjoyed a “great, in-depth” conversation. But Australian companies had been working on large battery projects for years, Garnaut said, including one by Zen Energy in the upper gulf of South Australia which it had discussed with the market. The core of the project would be to supply baseload renewable power to large energy users, initially in South Australia and then more broadly, Garnaut said. “In this Trump era, we have a world where nothing is real until an American billionaire tweets about it,” Garnaut said. “What we’re working on is having it ready for summer, the time of greatest stress on the grid and that’s when you really need to bring all your grid to stability. “Zen Energy has funded it all so far, and there has been a lot of technical work and economic modelling done to see what is required in the market. We have a lot of close relations with energy providers and communities as part of the development work. When it comes to investment in the large equipment, we have the support of external investors.” Zen would manage the battery and its interaction with the grid, but the owners of the battery would be external investors, Garnaut said. The battery would absorb electricity when it was cheap and abundant on the wholesale power market, and make it available when scarce. “The other value of the large battery is to grid stabilisations services,” he said. “We are focusing on providing 100Mwh of battery storage of energy, so it will make a substantial contribution and will be ready by summer.” On Tuesday the South Australian premier, Jay Weatherill, is due to release his energy plan, which is expected to address the blackouts and his vision for renewable energy. He did not return calls from Guardian Australia requesting comment on Monday. The chief executive of the Energy Storage Council, John Grimes, said there were a number of Australian companies that were more price-competitive than Tesla and which, in a consortium, could also deliver the project to stabilise South Australia’s energy grid in 100 days. “This isn’t just a ploy from Musk,” Grimes said. “He’s right, this really can be done.” He said there were a number of reasons the potential of battery storage hadn’t captured broader public attention before. Although Turnbull has a solar system and battery storage on his own Sydney property, Grimes said that “politically we have been in a backward-looking, unhelpful debate talking about so-called clean coal technology and running down state renewable energy targets”. “The second thing is rapidly changing economics,” Grimes said. “If you thought about doing this even three years ago the price would have been something like four times higher than what you can do it for today. “Really cheap battery technology, cheap solar and really smart energy technology systems, or smart computers, that will run this network are about to change everything. A massive transition is about to occur.” Within less than 10 years, the technology would be such that people could take control of their own energy requirements and enter into “Uber-style” energy sharing arrangements, he said. “We are not advocating people getting off the grid altogether, but the tech will allow us to trade electricity between ourselves so when I have excess solar power at 2pm I can offload it, for example, to a supermarket that needs two freezers running. “This revolution in energy begins in 2017 and it will be all done and dusted within 10 years.” He urged the federal government to show strong support for the battery sector as Australia risked losing some of the country’s best researchers. While Turnbull had been entertaining clean coal, the battery sector had advanced rapidly and come up to “bite him on the bum”, Grimes said. “We are slugging our guts out to build the business in this sector, but a tweet from Elon Musk grabs the government’s attention,” Grimes said. “I’m not saying Tesla should be excluded, but don’t fast-track a discussion with an overseas company when you have capability right here, right now, in Australia. Let there be a transparent bid process. And let’s give Australian companies a fair go.” The co-founder of Lyon solar, David Green, said not only had battery prices fallen substantially, but their functionality had increased significantly. Lyon is developing an advanced combination solar and battery storage plant in South Australia known as the Kingfisher project, which is connected to a grid with operational mining activities. Lyon expects it to be operating commercially and delivering 100Mwh of solar PV with up t0 40Mwh of battery storage by the end of the year. “The amazing thing is batteries are a technology with a range of functions,” he said. “They can function like a generator, they can act faster than any other generation facility to stabilise voltage, and they can provide power to isolated areas. “In Australia at present there are some issues that can be barriers to a commercial role for them, and some of those are institutional and some are cultural.” One barrier was the way regulators defined batteries under market rules, which differed depending on whether they were used as part of transmission networks or as generators. And Australian markets were not as familiar with the operation of batteries, he said. Lyon had well-advanced battery projects in every state, Green said. The company is working with US-based energy giant AES Energy Storage to develop 200-250 megawatts of large-scale battery storage using AES Energy’s technology. “All of our projects we have raised capital for, and it is the private sector who should be funding these projects,” Green said. “The principal role for government should be to get market settings right so projects like this can be commercialised. The government needs to help to create an environment where batteries can capture maximum revenue so they become commercial in their own right so that governments aren’t needing to provide subsidies.” The power the projects generated would be directed into the electricity grid for retailers to buy and sell on. “We will either sell the power directly into the market and take the risk on what pricing we get out of wholesale, or we will enter into a contract with a retailer who will buy a certain amount of power at a certain price and they put that into their portfolio of other contracts and on-sell that,” he said. Contract negotiations were under way between energy providers and Lyon, and an announcement would be made within weeks, Green said. The chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, Kane Thornton, said Australia was about to find out how close to being truly commercial battery energy storage technology was. “Sometimes it takes rockstar tech entrepreneurs having a Twitter conversation to create the excitement around technology breakthroughs,” Thornton said. “There’s nothing new in what Tesla are proposing. But I don’t think anyone should complain about Musk getting the attention of the prime minister about it. These are exciting times times ahead.”\n",

      "Text: Farmers are putting off planting trees because of the uncertainty surrounding the government’s plans for subsidies based on protecting nature, delaying the UK’s efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions and stem the drastic decline in farmland wildlife. New farm payments are expected from 2024, under the post-Brexit subsidy regime the government has promised, but farmers fear if they plant trees now they will not get the credit for it when the new schemes start. Meanwhile, they face potentially losing their existing subsidies if they switch to more tree-planting now. Ministers have repeatedly stressed that future payments to farmers will be on the principle of “public money for public goods”, meaning farmers will be paid for taking care of the land and wildlife, under “environmental land management contracts” or ELMs. But farmers have told the Observer there are too few details available about the expected new system, four years after it was promised by the government. This leaves farmers in limbo. If they use land currently in food production to plant trees, they could forfeit their existing subsidies, called basic payments. Many farmers are also tied into stewardship agreements with the government, under which they receive special subsidy payments for good environmental management. But these are so inflexible that farmers cannot plant trees as this would violate their agreement. “We are grateful for the stewardship payments, but it is difficult to change them,” said Martin Hole, a livestock farmer in Sussex. “Farmers are in a pinch. This is happening to me, and I hear it from many others. We want to plant trees, but there may be financial penalties if we do.” Hole wanted to triple the area of woodland on his farm, but could not make the finances work, as it would mean redrawing his current stewardship arrangement and he is unsure of any future support. Richard Bramley, an arable farmer south of York, who chairs the National Farmers’ Union environment forum, faces a similar quandary. He said the government had not yet set out details of how farmers would be encouraged to plant trees and hedgerows in future. “There is just so little information. Planting trees requires capital and time, and is a permanent change so you want to get it right.” Trees are an integral part of environmentally beneficial farming, as they provide habitats for wildlife, help prevent flooding, store carbon and clean the air. They also benefit farmers, providing shade and shelter for livestock, and encouraging pollinators. Planting trees requires significant investment, however. Rhys Evans, a beef and sheep farmer in south Snowdonia, is planting 1km of hedgerow, with fence poles costing £3 each and £30 for corners, even before the cost of the 7,000 saplings required, and labour. “It’s very expensive. There will be long-term benefits, and we want to do it, but many farmers who are less proactive will be put off,” he said. Martin Lines, chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, said farmers were increasingly aware of the benefits of trees and hedgerows, but needed more encouragement to start planting. “We’re getting mixed signals,” he said. “The government needs to give us more reassurance.” Organic farmers are also being deterred from investing in agroforestry, combining forestry with food production by growing trees that produce organic nuts and fruit in among crops or livestock pasture. Guy Singh-Watson, founder of Riverford, the vegetable box company, said: “Some of these trees are not native, they are European or American, so they might not be included in a requirement to plant native species. The government has shown little interest in agroforestry in general.” The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pointed to its scheme for farmers to plant as little as one hectare of trees. “By taking up grants such as the England Woodland Creation Offer now, farmers and landowners will be able to transfer into future environmental land management schemes at agreed points without having to repay their current funding,” a spokesperson said. However, farmers said the woodland creation scheme was not suitable for all farms, as it was geared to those who could afford to take a significant area out of production. Many are also concerned about what would happen if the trees failed, or were damaged by storms, deer or rabbits, as they could be held liable for fresh investment to replant the woodland. As many as one in four trees can require replanting, even in good circumstances. Farm subsidies are a devolved policy across the UK, but Scotland and Wales face similar issues. Hywel Morgan, with a hill farm in the western Brecon Beacons, told the Observer many farms nearby were being bought up by corporations to grow forests for carbon credits, to offset their carbon emissions. “What about those of us who want to continue as family farms? I can’t see how planting these trees but then importing food makes sense [for the environment]. I’d like to plant trees but to farm too.” Ministers must act faster, urged Ben Raskin, head of horticulture and agroforestry at the Soil Association. “This is a complex and long-term issue, but they should not make us wait until they have something they think is perfect. We would like to see some interim help at least, on agroforestry and hedgerows. Farmers want to be doing more now.”\n",

      "Text: Just a few yards from the choked M4 motorway, beyond the massive settling tanks and a steaming, 500-tonne mountain of black sewage sludge at Slough treatment works, a modern alchemy is taking place that could potentially keep the world in food for a few more years. The plant is taking the tiny quantities of phosphorus contained in the poo of the Berkshire town's 140,000 people and turning it into high-quality fertiliser fit to grow organic garden vegetables. At one end of the novel process in Europe's first \"nutrient recovery reactor\", the human waste is dark and \"earthy\" smelling. At the other end, bright white, odourless phosphorus-rich pellets drop into sacks. The sewage workers euphemistically say they are \"harvesting pearls\". Thames Water, which owns the facility, says it is making \"Viagra for plants\". According to the water company, Slough's excreta has a \"unique vintage\", and contains more phosphorus than any other area in south-east England, possibly because of the quantity of meat eaten in the town or because it boasts several large food processing and pharmacueutical works. The company expects to make £200,000 a year from the combination of selling 150 tonnes of its fertiliser to farmers and gardeners, and not having to spend as much money on chemicals to unblock pipes. \"We reckon using this technology Britain could save 20% of the 138,000 tonnes of phosphorus fertiliser that it imports a year,\" says Piers Clark, Thames Water's commercial director. \"Phosphorus is a fast-depleting, non-renewable resource which we will run out of. Without it, all life on the planet will take a nosedive.\" It is the key ingredient in fertiliser and essential for farming, says Peter Melchett, policy director of organic trade body the Soil Association. \"Without fertilisation from phosphorus, wheat yields will fall by more than half. This technology could offer a solution to securing global food supplies over the coming decades.\" \"Night soil\", or raw human excrement, was traditionally valued highly and spread over fields but because it contains dangerous pathogens and contaminants it is now banned. Instead, treated sewage sludge that still contains some heavy metals is given free to some farmers to use sparingly. The advantage of Slough's renewable phosphorus fertliser, says Clark, is that it is clean of contamination and quantities can be tailored for different crops. Mineable reserves of phosphorus in countries like Morocco, the US and China are set to be completely depleted in 100 years according to some experts while others say \"peak phosphorus\" will occur by 2035, after which it is expected to become increasingly scarce and expensive. Its price has risen 500% since 2007. \"The UK is heavily reliant on phosphate rock imports for food production. It can be a pollutant when its concentrations are too high because it leads to the explosive growth of algae which saps oxygen. Using it this way we can see it as valuable reseouce again\", said Rosanna Kleeman, a researcher studying Slough's sewage. \"Slough has taken some stick over the years from the likes of Sir John Betjeman and Ricky Gervais, who immortalised its trading estate in The Office. But we are rebranding it as an eco-warrior [town] at the forefront of the effort to save the planet,\" said Clark. A case, says one Thames worker, for Betjeman's famous line to be amended from \"Come, friendly bombs, and fall on Slough!\", to \"Come, friendly bums...\"\n",

      "Text: An invasive non-native ant species has become established in Italy and could rapidly spread through Europe to the UK with global heating, a study warns. The red fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, has a powerful sting, damages crops and can infest electrical equipment including cars and computers. The ant, considered one of the most destructive invasive species, can rapidly form “super colonies” with multiple queens. The colonies prey on invertebrates, larger vertebrates and plants, destroying native plants and out-competing native ants, insects and herbivores for food. The red fire ant is the fifth most costly invasive species in the world, spreading via human trade from its native South America into Mexico, the Caribbean, Australia and the US, where it causes an estimated damage of $6bn (£4.8bn) each year. Researchers have identified 88 red fire ant nests across 5 hectares (12 acres) near the city of Syracuse, in Sicily, Italy. According to genetic analyses in a study published in Current Biology, the invasive colonies could have come from China or the US. Roger Vila, the principal investigator at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology’s Butterfly Diversity and Evolution Lab, who led the study, said: “Coordinated efforts for early detection and rapid response in the region are essential to successfully manage this new threat, before it spreads uncontrollably.” The charity Buglife said invasive ant species were easily spread when plants in soil are imported into Britain and called on the government to ban the import of soil. The EU has banned the export of soil from the UK but the UK has not taken reciprocal measures to stop imports , mostly via the horticultural trade. David Smith, of Buglife, said: “It’s an open door for non-native species that are soil-dwellers. There’s widespread concern about these non-native invasive ant species of which this is one of a handful which are on the cusp of making it into Europe. “We can do something to stop these arriving but once an invasive ant species is here it’s going to be very hard to eradicate. Ants are notorious for being able to spread quickly.” In Europe, the ant has previously been found in imported products in Spain, Finland and the Netherlands but its establishment in the wild on the continent has never before been confirmed. While the EU has updated its “species of concern” list to include the red fire ant, the British government has not updated its list since Brexit despite calls from experts concerned about new invasive species. Smith added: “We’re getting increasingly frustrated at government delays over biosecurity measures.” Australia is spending A$400m (£205m) on the ant’s eradication but its government has been criticised for failing to act decisively enough to remove the species. New Zealand is the only country to have successfully eradicated the red fire ant after it appeared the country in 2001. The red fire ant is a heat-loving species but the researchers concluded that it could establish itself in approximately 7% of Europe. In today’s climate, half of the urban areas in Europe would be climatically suitable for it, including large cities such as London, Paris, Rome and Barcelona. With global heating, the continent will become much more suitable for the species and help its spread across Europe. Mediterranean coastal cities are the most suitable to the ant, and their seaports could facilitate its spread. Mattia Menchetti, the lead author of the study, said: “The public could play a key role in the detection of S invicta, considering that it is frequently found in urban and adjacent areas. It is possible to detect this ant due to its painful stings and the characteristic mounds of their nests, although confirmation of an expert is required.” The Sicilian colonies are located in an estuary and natural park in the suburbs of Syracuse. Researchers believe wind-assisted flying queen ants arrived there from the port of Syracuse to the north-west. The team has recommended further monitoring of the port.  This article was amended on 12 September 2023. An earlier image showed a weaver ant instead of a red fire ant.\n",

      "Text: In the pre-dawn darkness of Sierra de la Culebra, Zamora, Spain, a sudden howl pierces the cold. More join in, until the baying chorus echoes all around. As the sky begins to lighten, their shapes emerge: first the alpha male, and then the rest of the wolf pack, appearing in the twilight where light and darkness merge. In Europe, this large carnivore was hunted for centuries and almost exterminated, surviving only in inaccessible or sparsely populated areas. Now, thanks to changing attitudes and increased protection, Europe’s wolf population is slowly recovering, and the apex predators are gradually returning to their former territories. Spain – where Iberian wolves had dwindled to just 200-500 individuals by the 1970s – now has the highest concentration on the continent. As the animals return, however, the age-old conflict between shepherds and wolves has intensified. For the communities that live and tend animals in proximity to wolves, their return provokes a range of emotions, from fear to euphoria, and conflicts between humans and wolves are quick to resurface. In the pastoral settlements in the hills of northern Spain, shepherds are trying new strategies in an effort to coexist with these large carnivores. Fernando Rodríguez Tábara arrives on horseback wearing a wide-brimmed hat, at his home in Cerdillo, a village with just four registered inhabitants. Rodríguez Tábara knows a lot about the struggle for coexistence with wolves. At 22 years old, he already manages a farm inherited from his parents with more than 100 cows in one of the most densely populated wolf areas in Europe, the Sanabria area in Zamora. Tonight, however, he will leave his precious livestock to sleep without fear of wolves. His secret? His “army” of dogs, as he calls them: 13 mastiffs that guard the cattle. “Now, I sleep soundly,” he says, smiling. His mother, Luisa Tábara, tells us that it wasn’t always like this. “In 2012, wolves killed 12 calves, it was a tragedy. For me, my cows are part of my family,” she says. It was at that point, Rodríguez Tábara says, that some neighbours gave them mastiff puppies to raise alongside the cows and defend them against wolves. “My father told me it was impossible,” he says. Today, Rodríguez Tábara rides back to the mountains on his mare, Canela. The calves have started to be born, and the mastiffs never leave their side. “We put them in the stable with the calves from a young age, and in the end, they feel like part of the herd,” he says. “We realised that with the mastiffs, the problem is eradicated.” The temperature drops as evening falls near the Picos de Europa national park. The rocky silhouette of Espigüete peak stands out against a starry sky, as thousands of sheep make their way to the pen that Juan Díez has just set up. A transhumant shepherd, Díez started working with livestock at a very young age, following his grandfather in Extremadura. At the age of 17, he had his own flock and moved to Asturias. “That’s where I really got to know the wolf – because that summer it killed 121 of my animals,” he says. “Of course, I was an inexperienced kid.” Díez came from an area where the wolf had disappeared a long time before, along with traditional practices to prevent their damage. Later, he returned to León, near to the region where he had lost his animals, walking from Extremadura with more than 500 goats. But this time, he was prepared: the dogs he brought with him were mastiffs. “That year, they didn’t touch a single one,” Díez says. When the livestock is in an electric fencing enclosure or gathered with the dogs, “the wolf won’t get to them”, he says. Asked about the conflict between shepherds and wolves, he says: “Why did the dog enter the church? Because the door was open.” The recovery of wolf populations in Spain has taken decades. In the 1970s, with the wolf on the brink of extinction, naturalist Félix Rodríguez de la Fuente began campaigning to save the creatures. His work, along with that of other organisations, contributed to a significant change in mentality. The Iberian wolf went from being legal to hunt at any time to having the time and method of hunting regulated. In the 1990s, the wolf began to reappear timidly in places where it had long disappeared. Since 2021, a law has prohibited its hunting. Over the past year, however, the recovery of Iberian wolves has again become politicised in Spain, with right wing parties campaigning ahead of elections in July on the promise to make it legal to hunt them once more. Prevention-focused methods to control the wolves can result in a significant reduction in the number of dead or injured livestock: up to 61% in the case of mastiffs, 99.9% with electric fences, and 100% for fixed enclosures, according to WWF citing research by European project Coex. Sofía González Berdasco grew up as a transhumant shepherd in northern Spain, between the mountains of the Somiedo natural park in Asturias and the pastures of Santa Marina on the coast. Every night as a child, she went to sleep to stories like those of Little Red Riding Hood, but “they weren’t stories, they were real-life experiences”, she says. González Berdasco’s mother would send her young daughters to watch over the goats in the mountains because there were wolves. One summer’s day, while González Berdasco was tending the livestock, a wolf approached. She was five years old, and it was the first time she had seen one face to face. She saw it take one of the kids and disappear. “For us, our animals are like our family, and when a wolf comes and kills one of them, it hurts,” she says. “You still don’t have the idea of, well, the wolves killed a calf because they have to feed their pups, just like I love my kids.” Over time, González Berdasco discovered the importance of the role of large carnivores in the ecosystem, and decided she had to break the mental barrier: her fear of wolves. She ventured into the hills alone to spend the night in her sleeping bag in an area where she knew the wolves were. “I came back transformed; I conquered the last step, the most complicated one – the one in my soul,” she says. González Berdasco admits that sometimes she feels as if she is in a no man’s land, understanding the needs of shepherds and the wolf packs they live alongside. She now guides tourist groups with her company, Somiedo Experience. “Working with tourists, I see some who think that if the farmers here disappeared, the wolves could live, and that we, the people from the villages, are superfluous,” González Berdasco says. “And then I listen to many farmers who say that all the wolves should be killed, and it will be better for us. I don’t see that one side is more right than the other.” She believes that the only possibility for reaching an understanding is to sit down and negotiate. “Neither side can lose everything, and the other side gain everything.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X (formerly known as Twitter) for all the latest news and features\n",

      "Text: There are currently no credible plans to help the majority of households to improve their energy efficiency, the progress report from the Committee on Climate Change concludes: a gaping policy hole that is costing the UK dear, not just in climate terms but in unnecessarily high energy bills for our leaky homes. Insulating buildings would be the quickest and most effective way to counter soaring gas prices, but has been largely ignored by the government after the botched “green homes grant” was scrapped last year. Even our new homes are not efficient: at least 1.5m homes have been built in recent years that will require expensive retrofitting. “It’s a complete tale of woe,” said Chris Stark, chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change. “Surface transport has roared back,” after the lockdowns, according to Stark, with more people returning to their vehicles than boarding trains and buses. While some of these cars are now electric, not enough to make a real difference yet in emissions from transport – not helped by the increasing trend towards petrol-guzzling SUVs and the increasing size of even normal cars. Public transport strategy is also severely lacking, the report notes: “There has been only limited progress in encouraging a modal shift for transport and, most notably, no progress on addressing aviation demand and no action in response to our recommendation to assess airport capacity.” Some of the most stinging criticism from the CCC is for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Farming and land use make up about 12% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions, and the government has set what the CCC said were good targets for reducing them. But these targets have not been matched by policy, and emissions from farming and land have been flat since 2008, instead of falling as they need to. The government has been slow to decide how to provide taxpayer-funded incentives to farmers since Brexit, tree-planting and other conservation measures have fallen drastically short, and in the recent food strategy ministers rowed back further from environmental measures. Offshore wind is booming, solar panels are still increasing in popularity, and the plummeting cost of onshore wind makes it attractive and economical, where developers can get planning permission. The UK’s energy generation is a bright spot, with an increasing proportion of clean energy on the electricity grid that can help to lower prices for consumers overall. Some observers have expressed concern that the government is encouraging coal-fired power plants to increase generation temporarily, amid soaring gas prices and supply issues. Stark said this was not a concern: “It would be far worse to have a blackout.” “Diet and demand are not addressed in the [government’s] net zero strategy,” the report notes. The CCC has called for public information campaigns that make people aware of how they can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, for instance by educating people on the environmental and health impact of meat-heavy diets. Flying less, and using “active” transport such as walking and cycling more, would also help, and people can also be shown how to become more efficient users of energy in their homes and lives. But ministers have been reluctant to engage the public, perhaps out of a fear of being seen as “nannying” or admonishing people, to the evident frustration of the CCC. “This is not nannying, it is merely helping people to make their own choices,” said Lord Deben, chair of the CCC.\n",

      "Text: The Australia-based company Recharge Industries will take over collapsed battery maker Britishvolt after finalising a deal with administrators late on Sunday in the UK. The agreement revives hopes for the construction of a £3.8bn (A$6.7bn) “gigafactory” in northern England, the backbone of a plan to modernise the British automotive industry and supply the next generation of UK-built electric vehicles. The deal was finalised three weeks after Recharge, an Australian company that sits under New York-based investment firm Scale Facilitation, was nominated as preferred bidder, placing a huge opportunity, and burden, on a startup yet to construct a project. Scale Facilitation’s Australian-born founder and chief executive, David Collard, told the Guardian the factory and an associated supplier park, where components are manufactured, were still a focus. “We’re working closely with one of the leading UK fund managers looking to team [up] on the development,” Collard said. Recharge also plans to build a battery factory in Geelong, a former car manufacturing hub in Australia, free from Chinese and Russian materials. Britishvolt was planning to build its 30GWh factory in phases to take advantage of rising EV demand ahead of the UK’s 2030 ban of new petrol and diesel cars. The plant, located near Blyth in Northumberland, was expected to employ about 3,000 people when operating at full capacity. It had £100m in conditional financing from the British government, but failed to meet various hurdles. Britishvolt collapsed last month after running out of cash, with its demise partly blamed on the considerable sums it spent on battery technology and research. Part of Recharge’s pitch was focused on its existing relationship with American lithium-iron battery developer C4V, removing the need to develop new technology. The completion of the deal with administrators EY was first reported by the BBC. It means that the revived Britishvolt could make batteries using Australian minerals, including lithium, US technology and British manufacturing, representing the same three countries in the Aukus trilateral security pact. Collard said the company would initially focus on “developing a robust UK-specific business plan with global alignment”. Recharge has flagged interest in producing batteries for energy storage and the defence industry, which differs from Britishvolt’s original aim of making power batteries for 300,000 vehicles a year. Recharge’s bid won support from the British government’s trade envoy for Australia, the former England cricketer Ian Botham. It beat offers from existing Britishvolt investors, private equity firm Greybull Capital and the HSBC-backed Saudi British Bank. The UK will need 10 high-volume battery manufacturing facilities, or gigafactories, by 2040 according to British research body The Faraday Institution. It currently has one, a Chinese-owned battery plant next to the Nissan factory in Sunderland, and lags behind many European nations. The future of car manufacturing is tightly linked to battery production, as automotive brands look to bring the production facilities together. China is the world’s dominant EV battery maker.\n",

      "Text: The warm Atlantic current linked to severe and abrupt changes in the climate in the past is now at its weakest in at least 1,600 years, new research shows. The findings, based on multiple lines of scientific evidence, throw into question previous predictions that a catastrophic collapse of the Gulf Stream would take centuries to occur. Such a collapse would see western Europe suffer far more extreme winters, sea levels rise fast on the eastern seaboard of the US and would disrupt vital tropical rains. The new research shows the current is now 15% weaker than around 400AD, an exceptionally large deviation, and that human-caused global warming is responsible for at least a significant part of the weakening. The current, known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), carries warm water northwards towards the north pole. There it cools, becomes denser and sinks, and then flows back southwards. But global warming hampers the cooling of the water, while melting ice in the Arctic, particularly from Greenland, floods the area with less dense freshwater, weakening the Amoc current. Scientists know that Amoc has slowed since 2004, when instruments were deployed at sea to measure it. But now two new studies have provided comprehensive ocean-based evidence that the weakening is unprecedented in at least 1,600 years, which is as far back as the new research stretches. “Amoc is a really important part of the Earth’s climate system and it has played an important part in abrupt climate change in the past,” said Dr David Thornalley, from University College London who led one of the new studies. He said current climate models do not replicate the observed slowdown, suggesting that Amoc is less stable that thought. During the last ice age, some big changes in Amoc led to winter temperatures changing by 5-10C in as short a time as one to three years, with major consequences for the weather over the land masses bordering the Atlantic. “The [current] climate models don’t predict [an Amoc shutdown] is going to happen in the future – the problem is how certain are we it is not going to happen? It is one of these tipping points that is relatively low probability, but high impact.” The study by Thornalley and colleagues, published in Nature, used cores of sediments from a key site off Cape Hatteras in North Carolina to examine Amoc over the last 1600 years. Larger grains of sediment reflect faster Amoc currents and vice versa. They also used the shells of tiny marine creatures from sites across the Atlantic to measure a characteristic pattern of temperatures that indicate the strength of Amoc. When it weakens, a large area of ocean around Iceland cools, as less warm water is brought north, and the waters off the east coast of the US get warmer. The second study, also published in Nature, also used the characteristic pattern of temperatures, but assessed this using thermometer data collected over the last 120 years or so. Both studies found that Amoc today is about 15% weaker than 1,600 years ago, but there were also differences in their conclusions. The first study found significant Amoc weakening after the end of the little ice age in about 1850, the result of natural climate variability, with further weakening caused later by global warming. The second study suggests most of the weakening came later, and can be squarely blamed on the burning of fossil fuels. Further research is now being undertaken to understand the reasons for the differences. However, it is already clear that human-caused climate change will continue to slow Amoc, with potentially severe consequences. “If we do not rapidly stop global warming, we must expect a further long-term slowdown of the Atlantic overturning,” said Alexander Robinson, at the University of Madrid, and one of the team that conducted the second study. He warned: “We are only beginning to understand the consequences of this unprecedented process – but they might be disruptive.” A 2004 disaster movie, The Day After Tomorrow, envisaged a rapid shutdown of Amoc and a devastating freeze. The basics of the science were portrayed correctly, said Thornalley: “Obviously it was exaggerated – the changes happened in a few days or weeks and were much more extreme. But it is true that in the past this weakening of Amoc happened very rapidly and caused big changes.”\n",

      "Text: A large swathe of the Scottish Highlands stretching between the west coast and Loch Ness is to be rewilded as part of a 30-year project to restore nature. The Affric Highlands initiative aims to increase connected habitats and species diversity over an area of 200,000 hectares (500,000 acres), incorporating Kintail mountain range, and glens Cannich, Moriston and Shiel. Plans include planting trees, enhancing river corridors, restoring peat bogs and creating nature-friendly farming practices. The project has been launched after two years of conversations and meetings between local communities and conservationists from rewilding charity Trees for Life. Similar to the WildEast project in East Anglia, it is a community-led effort to restore nature over a large area, which organisers hope will be a catalyst for social and economic regeneration. “This was once a much more peopled landscape that was rich with wildlife and we think we can find new ways to establish that connection again, today,” said Alan McDonnell, a conservation manager at Trees for Life, and the project leader. “The idea of doing it at scale is that you get a much bigger natural response because you’ve got room for change and dynamism in that landscape.” The Affric Highlands initiative is located west of the Cairngorms Connect project, which is one of the UK’s largest land restoration projects at 60,000 hectares. In terms of total area, it is three times the size of Cairngorms Connect but at present only a quarter of the Affric Highlands area is managed by people who have signed up, including farmers, landowners and fishers. McDonnell hopes more will get involved once the project has launched. One of the challenges has been bringing together people reliant on traditional land management practices to work on large-scale landscape restoration. McDonnell has had meetings with around 50 local stakeholders and has been working with a psychologist to help him communicate with people who might feel sceptical, and to allay the fears of damage to livelihoods that have accompanied other rewilding projects in the UK. “Rewilding is a word that people define differently. For some people, it’s wolves and bears. For Trees for Life, it’s about the land, and what it can support,” he said. “We’re primarily motivated by the nature that will come with that, but that’s not to say that we don’t value everything that comes with it, so whether it’s opportunities for businesses and job creation, or natural capital and the ability to monetise that, there are a lot of ways we can use land better and increase what it can offer.” Native wildlife set to benefit includes a range of river species such as salmon, trout, ospreys and otters, as well as montane species such as golden eagles, red grouse, short-eared owls and mountain hares. Rewilding Europe helped fund the work with a €300,000 (£250,000) grant and it will be the organisation’s first UK project, one of nine across the continent. Other projects include Romania’s southern Carpathians, Croatia’s Velebit mountains, Italy’s central Apennines and Bulgaria’s Rhodope mountains. A £200,000 grant from the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation will help fund a two-year development period, during which time McDonnell will be recruiting three people to work on the project full-time. Practical work on the ground is set to begin in 2023. Trees for Life has already established 2 million trees as part of the restoration of the Caledonian Forest. In 2022, the charity expects to open its rewilding centre on the 4,000-hectare (10,000-acre) Dundreggan estate. The centre will have 40-bed accommodation, events spaces, classrooms and a cafe. McDonnell said: “In 10 years’ time I would hope to see some significant changes happening … in particular I would love there to be more riverbank woodlands, which would increase insect life, help fish species and support richer river ecosystems. That might mean fencing off part of a landowner’s riverbank, planting trees, or allowing natural regeneration.” The project also aims to help individuals get funding from government and other sources for green initiatives on their land, so people who sign up to it can financially benefit. Frans Schepers, managing director of Rewilding Europe, said: “Our decision to accept the project as our ninth rewilding area reflects the hard work and achievements of Trees for Life, its volunteers and its partners. Including Affric Highlands in our portfolio of major European rewilding areas will help magnify rewilding’s impact in the Highlands, and put it firmly on the global map.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features  The article was corrected on 24 September 2021.

      "Text: Almost 90% of the $540bn in global subsidies given to farmers every year are “harmful”, a startling UN report has found. This agricultural support damages people’s health, fuels the climate crisis, destroys nature and drives inequality by excluding smallholder farmers, many of whom are women, according to the UN agencies. The biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as beef and milk, received the biggest subsidies, the report said. These are often produced by large industrialised groups that are best placed to gain access to subsidies. Without reform, the level of subsidies was on track to soar to $1.8tn (£1.3tn) a year by 2030, further harming human wellbeing and worsening the planetary crisis, the UN said. Support for the “outsized” meat and dairy industry in rich countries must be reduced, while subsidies for polluting chemical fertilisers and pesticides must fall in lower-income countries, the analysis said. The report, published before a UN food systems summit on 23 September, said repurposing the subsidies to beneficial activities could “be a game changer” and help to end poverty, eradicate hunger, improve nutrition, reduce global heating and restore nature. Good uses of public money could include supporting healthy food, such as vegetables and fruit, improving the environment and supporting small farmers. Numerous analyses in recent years have concluded the global food system is broken, with more than 800 million people experiencing chronic hunger in 2020 and 3 billion unable to afford a healthy diet, while 2 billion people are obese or overweight, and a third of food is wasted. The total damage caused has been estimated at $12tn a year, more than the value of the food produced. The report was published by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and is an underestimate of the total subsidies in the food system, as it only includes those for which reliable data is available in 88 countries. “This report is a wake-up call for governments around the world to rethink agricultural support schemes to make them fit for purpose to transform our agri-food systems and contribute to the four betters: better nutrition, better production, better environment and a better life,” said Qu Dongyu, the FAO director general. The UNDP head, Achim Steiner, said redirecting the subsidies would also boost the livelihoods of the 500 million smallholder farmers worldwide by ensuring a more level playing field with industrial agriculture. Marco Sánchez, the FAO deputy director and an author of the report, said: “Current support to farms needs transforming for today’s realities. For instance, the US is now aligning to the Paris climate agreement, which is very welcome, but there is no way they can achieve those climate goals if they don’t tackle the food industries.” Joy Kim, at UNEP, said: “Agriculture contributes a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, 70% of biodiversity loss and 80% of deforestation.” She said international finance pledges for climate change were $100bn a year and $5bn a year for deforestation. “But governments are providing $470bn [in farm support] that has a huge damaging impact on climate and nature.” The report found that between 2013 and 2018, support to farmers totalled an average of $540bn a year, of which 87% ($470bn) was “harmful”. This included price incentives for specific livestock and crops, subsidies for fertilisers and pesticides, and distorting export subsidies and import tariffs. These damage health by promoting the overconsumption of meat in rich countries and overconsumption of low-nutrition staples in poorer ones. “If you are not promoting fruits and vegetables, then in relative terms it is very expensive for the consumer to eat healthily,” said Sánchez. “That’s why 2 billion people in the world cannot afford a healthy diet.” The report highlighted some cases of positive action, such as moves in China to cut chemical fertiliser and pesticide use, and the zero budget natural farming policy in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The UK is also shifting its £3bn-a-year subsidy scheme towards environmental goals. Some subsidies should also be redirected to help farmers cope with the increasing extreme weather impacts of the climate crisis, the report said. The EU is to pay €387bn (£330bn) in farm subsidies from 2021 to 2027, but last Thursday green MEPs in Brussels said a planned overhaul failed to align agriculture with EU climate change targets. Overhauling farm support in the face of vested interests was hard, said Sánchez, but could be done by spelling out the costs to governments, by consumers demanding better and by financial institutions stopping lending to damaging activities. “The true costs of our food system have been hidden for too long,” said Morgan Gillespy, the programme director at the Food and Land Use Coalition. The damage caused to nature by subsidy regimes was $4tn to $6tn, according to a recent review, she said. “Changes in subsidy regimes are likely to be politically controversial and could spark protests among farmers and other groups,” Gillespy said. “But just because it is hard, doesn’t mean it shouldn’t happen. The facts are now clear.” Consultation with farmers was vital, she said. Copa-Cogeca, the largest interest group for Europe’s farmers did not respond to a request for comment. A separate report, published by the World Resources Institute in August, said without reform, farm subsidies “will render vast expanses of healthy land useless”. It said: “Given that the world will have 10 billion people by 2050, the loss of this land will make it impossible to feed the global population.” Instead, farmers should be supported to restore their land through techniques such as agroforestry, it said.\n",

      "Text: Engaging with major fossil fuel companies on climate change has become futile, according to one of the UK’s most esteemed environmentalists who spent years working on sustainability projects with BP and Shell. Jonathon Porritt said “hydrocarbon supremacists” at the companies had successfully ousted reformers wanting to diversify into green energy. The founder director of non-profit consultancy Forum for the Future (FFF), said: “We came to the conclusion that it was impossible for today’s oil and gas majors to adapt in a timely and intelligent way to the imperative of radical decarbonisation. We felt we had no option but to end our long-standing partnerships with both Shell and BP.” Porritt brought the Ecology Party – now the Green Party – to prominence in the 1970s and was later director of Friends of the Earth. He has advised the Prince of Wales, Marks & Spencers and many others. Writing in the Guardian, Porritt said: “These are companies whose senior managers know, as an irrefutable fact, that their current business model threatens both the stability of the global economy and the longer-term prospects of humankind as a whole. It got harder and harder for me to look them in the face knowing what they knew, and witnessing at first hand the intricate patterns of denial and self-deception that they were forced to adopt.” Oil, gas and coal companies are being targeted by a fast-growing campaign that aims to stigmatise them by persuading investors to dump their fossil fuel shares, a call backed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and others. In parallel, a series of authoritative analyses have shown that only a quarter of existing, exploitable fossil fuels reserves are burnable if global warming is not to exceed the dangerous 2C level agreed as the limit by the world’s nations.  One counter-argument to divestment has been that holding on to shares and engaging with the companies is more effective in driving change. The Church of England has resisted calls to divest its endowment completely for this reason. “Our approach is to get stuck in on ethical issues and try and have a positive influence,” said Church Commissioner Edward Mason in December. But Porritt said this time has now passed and that the unburnable carbon analysis has left the fossil fuel companies “entirely unmoved”. “There was a time when I seriously persuaded myself that it was still just about possible for companies like Shell and BP to find some way of transitioning into ‘fully-integrated energy companies’, investing as much in renewables, storage and efficiency as in hydrocarbons, instead of reverting to what they are today: pure-play hydrocarbon dinosaurs,” he wrote in a recent blog. “It didn’t happen. Worse yet, the lengths they went to to justify their continuing investments in new hydrocarbons have become more and more extreme.” Over $670bn (£442bn) was spent in 2013 exploring for new fossil fuels reserves. Shell is spending billions on Arctic exploration and Canadian tar sands projects, both of which were deemed incompatible with preventing dangerous climate change according to a recent analysis in the journal Nature. “With BP the moment [for transition] came and went under the leadership of John Browne and with Shell, it pretty much died after Mark Moody-Stuart moved on,” Porritt wrote in the Guardian. “In both companies, the hydrocarbon supremacists rapidly regained the ground they’d lost: doing renewables as Corporate Social Responsibility was fine, but anything that threatened to go seriously ‘beyond petroleum’ was deemed to be deviant heresy.” Shell, Exxonmobil and Statoil have all been forced to respond recently to concerns about a “carbon bubble”. This is the suggestion that promised international action to curb climate change by drastically cutting fossil fuel burning will make many fossil fuels reserves worthless in the future, an idea being taken seriously by the Bank of England, Goldman Sachs, Citibank and other financial institutions. Porritt said fossil fuel companies are ultimately doomed, if not in the short term. “It has been quite a painful journey for me personally. I so badly wanted to believe that the combination of reason, rigorous science and good people would enable elegant transition strategies to emerge in those companies,” he said. “But we learn as we go. And go those companies surely will, if not in the near future.” Note: The Rockefeller Brothers Fund have divested from fossil fuels, not the Rockefeller Foundation as the original version of this article wrongly stated.\n",

      "Text: UK consumers could be eating Australian beef linked to deforestation on the back of a new post-Brexit free trade deal signed in the summer, an investigation has found. Satellite analysis has identified an area of deforestation over the past three years that is more than twice the size of Manhattan across farms in Queensland, the largest beef-producing state in Australia. The deforestation includes the habitats of threatened species such as koalas, flying foxes, quolls, and several endangered species of bird and frog. “Millions of native animals, including Australia’s iconic koala are killed or left homeless when bulldozes destroy their habitat,” said Gemma Plesman, Queensland campaign manager for the Wilderness Society, who carried out the satellite analysis with Unearthed, the investigative arm of Greenpeace. . Australia is the only country in the developed world in WWF’s list of global deforestation hotspots. About 3% of the forest area in eastern Australia, which includes Queensland, was lost between 2004 and 2017. Under the terms of the trade deal signed this year, Australia’s beef producers will be given tariff-free access to the UK market. But campaigners argue that beef is the number one driver of the country’s deforestation crisis, and particularly in Queensland. The Queensland government introduced new laws aimed at curbing deforestation in 2018, yet the analysis says loopholes are allowing clearing to continue. The analysis found more than 13,500 hectares (33,359 acres) of deforestation across 57 properties, with more than half of the cleared area (56%) across 54 beef properties categorised as where habitats for threatened species are “likely to occur”. The loophole identified by Unearthed exempts vast tracts of hectares of forests that have previously been cleared even if they are over 15 years old and supposed to be classified as “high-value regrowth”.  More than two-thirds of the deforestation identified in the analysis is forest or woodland mapped as exempt from all clearing restrictions despite being over 15 years old and having grown back to maturity. Regrowth forests can often be vital habitats for threatened species. A Queensland civil servant who has worked on the subject, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they “can represent a significant fraction of the remaining extent of endangered ecosystems”. Dr April Reside, a lecturer in wildlife science at the University of Queensland, said the level of clearing identified by the study was “really substantial”, adding that deforestation risked fragmenting and degrading species habitats, leaving them exposed to invasive species. Among the 82 species found to be losing habitat was the Southern black-throated finch, an endangered bird which was found to be losing 364 ha. Reside said: “That’s definitely something to be concerned about … they’ve already lost 88% of their original extent. So they’ve got a very small proportion of habitat left, and what they do have left is highly degraded and is not about finch conservation. And it’s still being cleared.” “There are ways of growing beef that don’t destroy the environment. Broad-scale land clearing is just lazy … you don’t have to clear habitats and drive species to extinction in order to get your food,” said Prof Brendan Wintle, a conservation ecologist at the University of Melbourne. The environment bill which became law last month tackles only deforestation in the supply chain that is illegal under local laws. “Nobody wants to be responsible for deforestation,” said Dustin Benton, policy director for thinktank Green Alliance. “If the rules can’t guarantee that, or we can’t even get a rider in the UK-Australia trade deal, then they simply don’t work.”  The National Farmers’ Union said: “The NFU has been clear about its concerns over the agreement in principle with Australia, which could see increased imports of Australian goods, produced at much lower costs and at vast scales of production. There has also been no clarity about how the deal works in tandem with the UK’s environmental and climate ambitions. “We believe that the UK’s trade policy should champion the climate-friendly food we produce in this country, where we make the most of our maritime climate. Food produced in this way is a far cry from food produced in areas of deforestation or suffering from extreme drought.” A spokesperson for the Queensland Department of Resources said the 2018 laws provided greater protection to high-value remnant and regrowth vegetation and important habitats, including essential habitat for near-threatened wildlife. “Our responsible vegetation management laws continue protect our valuable environment, habitats and the Great Barrier Reef while allowing landholders to manage and grow farm operations that are fundamental to jobs and our economic recovery post-Covid.” Australia’s Red Meat Advisory Council, the Cattle Council of Australia, AgForce Queensland were all approached for comment. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “With our world-leading Environment Act now law, the UK is committed to go further than ever before to clamp down on illegal deforestation and protect forests. Following the COP26 summit, we will maintain the trajectory set by the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration and the Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade Dialogue on halting and reversing forest loss and greening global supply chains.”\n",

      "Text: Today UK and other European Union representatives will discuss whether to limit the amount of first-generation biofuels used in transport fuels. On a day that is also World Food Day, the importance of these negotiations, which will significantly impact the trajectory of global food prices, could not be overstated. Many of these old-fashioned biofuels are derived from food crops, such as wheat and oilseed rape, which are essential food sources for a rapidly expanding global population. If the EU doesn't take this opportunity to change its policy, it risks creating demand for biofuels that could take up twice the land mass of Belgium. Not only do first-generation biofuels not deliver the carbon emissions savings that they are subsidised to provide, but the demand for land to be used for biofuels puts great strain on the environment, wildlife and local communities ('Silent genocide' fear over Guarani suicides, 11 October). Taking land out of food production – which is increasingly happening in Africa – pushes up global food prices, while bringing new land into production leads to drained wetlands, ploughed-up grasslands and razed forests. This can result in huge emissions of greenhouse gases. The Lithuanian presidency of the EU is not pushing for a tight enough cap on damaging biofuels, nor pushing for measures to capture their full climate impacts, and we urge the UK government to show leadership in the negotiations and encourage other member states to support a 5% cap that will stop further increases in the use of food for fuel.Zac Goldsmith MP (Con), Caroline Lucas MP (Green), Jeremy Lefroy MP (Con), Tim Farron MP (LD), Julian Huppert MP (LD), Adrian Sanders MP (LD), Fiona O'Donnell MP (Lab), Mark Durkan MP (SDLP)\n",

Environmentalists said the Valeria mine would destroy habitat for threatened species and threaten farmland, and put a question mark over the company’s climate goals. But Glencore said it was yet to decide if it would commit financially to the project, which would have to fit within its commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. That goal, the company has said, also includes the burning of the coal the company sells. In 2019, the company said it would not increase its coal production after pressure from investors. Company documents say the mine would produce between 14m and 16m tonnes of coal a year from six open-cut pits in the Bowen Basin with an expected lifespan of 35 years. According to documents sent to the federal government this month, there are four plants and nine animals that are considered threatened but that could be present at the mine site. There are also three threatened ecological communities that would be affected, with some of those areas needing to be cleared. Surveys carried out between 2019 and 2021 recorded hundreds of species, including 334 plants, 132 birds, 34 mammals, 37 reptiles, 16 fish, 10 frogs and 10 introduced species. Koalas, greater gliders and squatter pigeons that are all considered to be vulnerable to extinction were recorded at the site. Koalas and greater gliders were also seen in areas the company would use to build a 67km rail line. The company said the project covered 29,501 hectares with about 10,364 hectares that would need to be cleared for the mine, workers’ camp, and access road. The company has sent five documents to the federal government – covering the mine and other infrastructure including roads and rail – that will now be considered by the environment minister under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Director of the Queensland Conservation Council, Dave Copeman, said: “We can develop other projects that would create longer-lasting jobs and economic opportunities for regional Queensland without trashing the planet.” He said the production of coal for power generation “must end by 2030 if we are to stay below 1.5 degrees of global heating” and the methane emissions from the proposed open-cut pits would be “a climate nightmare.” Ellie Smith, of campaign group Lock the Gate Queensland, said there was no justification for a future approval of the project. She said: “The Valeria coal project poses an unacceptable risk to farmland and to Theresa Creek, a known habitat of numerous threatened species and a waterway relied on by communities in the region for agriculture.” She said the plan for the mine made the company’s climate goals “look like nothing more than greenwashed propaganda.” In a statement, Glencore could not say when a final investment decision might be made. But the company said it was carrying out studies into the Valeria coal resource as the project moved through the state and federal assessment process. Glencore has committed to cutting emissions by 15% by 2026, 50% by 2035 and to be a “net zero total emissions business” by 2050. The statement said: “The development of any coal project, including Valeria, will take into account Glencore’s climate change strategy and stated emission reduction targets.” The Queensland government granted the mine special status last year, streamlining the approvals process.\n",

      "Text: Green organisations were today assessing how hard they would be hit by the £250m of cuts imposed by the coalition government. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) will lose £162m, or 5.5% of its budget, and the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc), a comparatively minor £85m, or 2.5%. But both departments said today they would not be able to deliver the savings solely by limiting recruitment and making in-house spending and would be forced to cut capital programmes. Britain's 200,000 farmers and landowners, who receive tens of billions of pounds of European subsidies for owning land and growing food, will escape most of the cuts because European common agricultural policy payments are made directly from Brussels. But conservation and green building efforts may be severely hit by a significant withdrawal of funding for regional development agencies which subsidise many agricultural, environment and renewable energy schemes. Defra, which oversees planning, recycling, waste and conservation efforts and large watchdog organisations like the Environment Agency and Natural England, said it would have to slash capital programmes \"across the board\". A spokeswoman said that it could take \"weeks\" to finalise details. \"Nothing has been decided yet,\" she said. However, she added that the cuts would include flood defence funding, surveillance of some diseases, and IT programmes for farmers. Many of Defra's \"daughter\" or \"arm's-length\" bodies like British Waterways are also expected to be hit hard. Decc, which spends far less on administration than Defra, is expected to have to cut deeply into home energy-efficiency programmes which could undermine the public take-up of low-carbon technologies. \"It will be challenging for Decc as it already has low administrative spend, so we will have to look at some of our programme work,\" said a spokesman. He added that budget cuts would be made to as yet unallocated funds and no existing programmes would be hit. The department's three largest delivery bodies, the Nuclear Decommissioning Agency, the Carbon Trust and the Energy Saving Trust, are all expected to see budgets cut by an average of 1% this year. The Environmental Transformation Fund, which invests in emerging low-carbon technologies, will see its budget for this year cut by 22% to £120m, and the Low-Carbon Building Programme (LCBP), a grant scheme to support the installation of clean energy technologies in homes, will end immediately and will not be extended. LCBP grants for electricity-generating systems such as solar photovoltaics and wind turbines had already been withdrawn following the introduction of feed-in-tariffs that reward homeowners for each unit of clean power they produce. But until the government's announcement on Monday, grants were still available for heat-producing technologies such ground-source heat pumps and solar water heaters. The scheme is now closed to new applicants. Although the ending of the LCBP is a relatively small cut – the savings will be just £3m – the announcement will most likely mean there will be no support for greener heating systems until at least spring 2011, when Labour's proposed Renewable Heat Incentive scheme is scheduled for launch. Any cuts that Defra makes come on top of similar swingeing cuts made in 2007-08 and 2008-09 when £200m was slashed from the budgets of British Waterways, nature conservation organisations and other environment initiatives. \"We have been cut to the bone already. There's not much left to slash,\" said one Defra insider today. Environment groups reacted cautiously to the cuts. Ben Stafford, head of campaigns at the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) said: \"The pledge to cut £600m from quangos looks politically attractive, although we don't at the moment know exactly where these cuts might fall. Ministers must recognise that cuts to public bodies will not always be consequence-free. A number perform important functions in the fields of planning and natural environment protection, and it is important that their departments champion these functions, including the ongoing importance of independent advice to ministers. Swinging the axe too vigorously now could mean greater costs later.\" Paul King, the chief executive of the UK Green Building Council, said: \"The coalition must be careful that the proposed abolition of Regional Spatial Strategies does not result in missed opportunities to deliver sustainable infrastructure, such as heat, water and waste across local authority borders. Integrated policy to deliver these services can offer carbon and cost savings – which can be missed if we don't have a regional overview.\" The RSPB today urged the government to consider the health of the environment when it makes its decisions about where to cut and where to invest. \"We are calling to the government to freeze the costly and environmentally perverse Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation [which drives demand for unsustainable biofuels], protect existing co-financing funding for agri-environment schemes, invest in marine protected areas and end the investment by the nationalised banks in climate polluting activities,\" said a spokesman.\n",

      "Text: Last March, Tim Jackson put forward the idea of prosperity without growth in a report published by the United Kingdom's Sustainable Development Commission and followed up with a book of the same name released last November.  The book is a best seller (ranked 1,729 on Amazon) and in it he argues convincingly that we can still prosper without adhering to the encoded mantra of expansion and growth that permeates modern market economies. More recently, in January 2010, Andrew Simms and Victoria Johnson at the new economics foundation (nef) published a more emphatic message in their report entitled Growth isn't possible. They argue that we should abandon the notion of growth altogether. The premise is that we need a new economic model \"that allows the human population as a whole to thrive without having to rely on ultimately impossible endless increases in consumption\". In influential forums — like the G8 or G20, for instance — while it is acceptable and even desirable to use the word 'sustainability' in communiqués, it is most certainly taboo to equate 'no economic growth' to a social good. However, such heresy nonetheless finds traction (if only in book sales), even when our world is suffering from the ills of economic recession. When addressing our environmental ills, the closest we ever seem to get is 'decoupling'. This idea has been around for decades and essentially suggests that we can break the links between economic growth and nasty side effects like pollution (e.g., carbon dioxide). Decoupling is done by producing things more efficiently — using less (and preferably renewable) energy, or using technology to capture the pollution.  However, Jackson says that this relative decoupling is only possible to a certain level. He believes absolute decoupling is a myth — simply the acceptable face of sustainability that leaves our complex social and economic systems unchanged. Stuff, stuff, and more stuff  Generally, we humans don't really like complexity or understanding how things work too much. For many of us, it is a bit of a shock to be confronted by some of the realities. You can find a good illustration of this in The Story of Stuff, which does a nice (albeit heavily politicised) job of illustrating the linkages within the modern economy: from where we get our resources, to their production, consumption and disposal. You either love or truly hate this story. Some of the more inquisitive may want to look more deeply into \"stuff\", but I suspect many will convulsively reject it as heresy. After all, growth is good and without wealth there is no progress and what you don't know, doesn't hurt you. At the same time, there are several important and accepted norms that dictate how the economy works and the role that consumption plays. For example, companies' first obligations are to shareholders, governments plan their spending based on the assumption of growth, and investors expect interest on their monies lent. Our role as consumers is to fuel that growth (preferably borrowing money in the process). It is therefore entirely understandable that governments, businesses and consumers have little choice but to be obedient followers of the Growth God: otherwise uncertainty would prevail, revenues would fall and social stability would be threatened. At a personal level, all this talk of growth focuses on the consumer cycle. Most of us like new things and the feeling of satisfaction (sometimes fleeting) that these things provide. And a large part of our modern society is optimized to meet these consumption habits with ever more innovative products delivered with ever increasing efficiency, even to the point of not having to leave the comfort of your home. Ironically, it is this increasing efficiency — coupled with advancing technology and connected trade systems — that often breaks the link between the consumer and the consequences of their manufactured goods and results in social vulnerability when growth slows. Individually, we are often unwittingly runners on this treadmill. Fortunately, it is the buzz of this consumer exercise that helps us deal with the stress it creates. Governments are hopelessly addicted and try frantically to get us back on the treadmill like the overbearing trainer whose job is on the line if you don't perform. Far from this latest financial and economic crisis being a time of reflection, the main priority is to get growing again. Yet, as American author Edward Abbey once wrote, \"growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell\". Reforming an economic system that mandates growth on a finite planet requires drastic changes in how we do business. Therefore, in order to avoid the pain of environmental chemotherapy, many are developing alternative therapies. Better, not bigger The notion that our progress (and happiness) equates to our consumption became very strongly embedded in economic policy not least because we can measure consumption, and although we know it's imperfect at some level, it works. There is however, a whole array of proposals aimed at redressing this. For example, the Redefining Progress approach is based on broadening our conception of affluence beyond Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to the Genuine Progress Indicator. The 'capability approach', articulated by India's Nobel Prize winning economist Amartya Sen and others, has provided the basis for the Human Development Index and mainstream acceptance of wider measures of welfare. Some are advocating economic changes that address the key problems affecting the world's resources and climate systems. Jackson, believes, as many have long warned, that we must recognise that exponential growth interacts with resources so that we may begin to adjust our economic activity in the face of scarcity and constraint. (This notion seems to be experiencing a revival, see our recent Survivalism back in vogue). \"Prosperity consists in our ability to flourish as human beings — within the ecological limits of a finite planet,\" states Jackson in the report. \"The challenge for our society is to create the conditions under which this is possible. It is the most urgent task of our times.\" So, beyond concepts of green growth or sustainable growth there is also that of 'no growth'. The latter is distinguished by the fact that it does not equate 'development' with economic expansion. The so-called steady state economy would look very different than our current system. We may share jobs, which would mean less income but, if we must still believe that time is money, increasing our time capital would afford us the luxury of doing the things that money can't, or would no longer be needed to, buy. The Center for the Advancement of the Steady State Economy has summarised a number of policies from leading thinkers in this area. Changing attitudes How does such a thing happen? Will everyone come on board? The reality is that changing any system is always hard because we are not rewarded for doing things differently or because we receive perverse incentives not to change (i.e., fossil fuels still heavily subsidized). Some of the ideas laid out in the above-mentioned publications may initially sound awfully undesirable. But are they really? Or is it just because they don't fit with how we currently define prosperity? The tricky part is getting individuals to think about changing. The provocative author and new urbanist James Howard Kunstler puts it simply: people need to stop thinking of themselves as consumers. He argues that consumers do not have obligations, responsibilities or duties to their fellow human beings. \"As long as you are using that word 'consumer', you will be degrading the quality of the public discussion as we go into the very difficult future that we face.\" So while today we cannot deny that we are part of a mass consumer culture, it is a culture that to which we should begin waving goodbye. Perhaps luckily, mass consumerism is still a relatively new phenomenon; it is essentially a leftover of post-war excess productive capacity allied to ingenious marketing that plays a crucial role in stimulating various desires and dissatisfactions and keeps the consumer ball rolling. The culture-jamming magazine Adbusters considers advertising to be akin to intellectual pollution and aims to reform current perceptions of advertising in modern society, often using subversive counter advertisements. Maybe what we really need is more space and time to reflect on these issues. Interestingly, Clay Shirky coined the term cognitive surplus to describe the little free time that our structured working lives allow. He explains how this time is currently filled largely by watching television (and shopping). Some of his figures are astounding: 200 billion hours of TV are watched in the US each year and 100 million hours/weekend are spent just watching adverts. This vast cognigitve surplus could be better employed, he argues, by using our time creatively rather than consumptively. The creative awakening enabled by the internet is transforming some of us from consumers to producers and sharers of music, video, knowledge and so on. It is early days, and we still don't fully comprehend the way the internet is altering our social and economic norms and it will certainly be employed on both sides of the consumption debate. But, if we can change the way we use media, then why not also the way we consume material things?\n",

      "Text: The plants slowly choke to death, wither and dry out. They die en masse, leaves dropping and bark turning grey, creating a sea of monochrome. Since scientists first discovered Xylella fastidiosa in 2013 in Puglia, Italy, it has killed a third of the region’s 60 million olive trees – which once produced almost half of Italy’s olive oil – many of which were centuries old. Farms stopped producing, olive mills went bankrupt and tourists avoided the area. With no known cure, the bacterium has already caused damage costing about €1bn. “The greatest part of the territory was completely destroyed,” says Donato Boscia, a plant virologist and head researcher on Xylella at the Institute for Sustainable Plant Protection in Bari. A decade later, far from nearing resolution, the threat to European plants from Xylella and other diseases is only growing: in February 2024, Puglia scientists found another Xylella subspecies, which had annihilated US vineyards and never previously been detected in Italy. For many farmers, scientists and regulators, the disease is emblematic of a far broader problem: the EU’s difficulty curtailing the introduction of devastating new plant diseases, despite regulatory efforts over the past decade. New data, released to the Guardian, shows that dozens of newly introduced disease outbreaks are detected in the EU every year, even as farmers and scientists struggle to contain previously introduced pathogens. As the climate heats, scientists warn the problem will get worse. Across the EU, data shows, outbreaks of newly introduced plant disease have continued unabated at an average rate of 70 a year between 2015 and 2020, despite regulations introduced to stop their spread in 2016. While a number of member states have taken steps to prevent and curb the outbreaks, scientists, plant epidemiologists and agronomists say it is still insufficient. “I can’t understand how, after Xylella, we learned almost nothing,” says Pierfederico La Notte, an Italian plant epidemiologist. On a scorching June morning in 2023, Paolo Solmi, a phytosanitary inspector at the port of Ravenna in northern Italy, tells his team to open the first of 28 containers of Egyptian potatoes to check that day. They fill bags with 100 potatoes each before taking them to the labs for EU standardised tests. “Once these checks have been passed, the goods are free to move within the European Union,” Solmi says. The EU has an open import system: everything that is not known to be harmful can enter. Some countries, such as New Zealand and Chile, have opted for a closed system: everything is considered guilty until proven innocent. Evidence shows that the Xylella bacteria came from Latin America and, most likely, got a ride from ornamental coffee plants passing through the Netherlands. About 30 billion rooted and unrooted plants, cuttings, bulbs and tissues came from third countries into Europe between 2005 and 2014, mainly through Dutch ports. According to Alberto Santini, a forest pathologist at the Italian National Research Council, such an open system has been letting in an alarming number of plant pests and diseases from third countries. “If you know your enemy, you can try to stop it from entering your country,” Santini says. But, he added, many pathogens are harmless elsewhere because ecosystems evolved with them. While Xyllela might not have affected coffee plants in Costa Rica, it thrived when it met the defenceless southern Italian olive trees. The EU introduced new regulations in 2016 to better manage what gets in and how, and to deal with outbreaks quickly. Still, with so many ports of entry, scientists and regulators can’t keep up with the volumes coming in. Trioza erytreae, a sap-sucking pest, has been endangering Portuguese citrus; a bacterium infecting carrots and celery has been raising concerns around the continent; and Hymenoscyphus fraxineus has been killing ash trees in Poland. Many scientists fear the spread will be helped by the climate crisis, which is making Europe a warmer, more hospitable place for foreign plant pests to thrive. “With the current system in Europe, we continuously introduce new organisms,” La Notte says. “In the context of climate change, it will be more and more difficult to manage them.” Data provided to the Guardian by Wopke van der Werf and Hongyu Sun, researchers at Wageningen University and Research in the Netherlands, shows that there were 1,720 recorded outbreaks of alien plant disease between 1975 and 2020 in the EU, with Italy, France and Spain accounting for half of them. 2018 was the worst year, with 115 known cases. The data is drawn from the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) database, which records where alien plant diseases – outbreaks caused by alien insects, pathogens and nematodes – are found for the first time or in a new region inside the union. That data is likely an underestimate: EPPO collects new findings by scanning the scientific literature and acquiring official pest reports from its member countries’ national plant protection organisations, so its reports are limited to each country’s responsiveness and interest in investigating an uncommon pest sighting. According to La Notte, a few crops – such as grape vines – are heavily regulated. But many others, especially ornamental plants, are treated more leniently, making them potential carriers of alien plant pests. Wooden pallets, internet plant sales, and travellers carrying prohibited plants or fruits are all responsible for bringing in diseases, according to several researchers interviewed for this story. For some countries, such as the Netherlands, open trade in plants is a core part of their history and economy – and they have been resistant to increased regulation. Christian Linden, the founder and CEO of IBH Export, walks around his 14,000-sq metre storage area in the Aalsmeer Flower Auction house in the Netherlands. He imports cut flowers and pot plants, mostly from Turkey and east Africa, and redistributes them around Europe. Linden says he doesn’t know much about pathogens or bugs entering through the plant trade, but isn’t concerned because the phytosanitary authorities “are very strict”. He thinks the 2016 plant health regulation created higher protection for the EU, and points out the introduction of plant passports, which did not exist when Xylella arrived in Italy. Today, he adds, if one customer finds a disease or a bug on an imported plant, the whole shipment is tracked down and destroyed. “When it’s necessary to protect the environment, you have to do it,” he says. John Van Ruiten, the former director of Naktuinbouw, the Netherlands inspection service for horticulture, says their controls on imported material are strict. However, he admits it’s hard to detect everything – insects, symptoms of bacteria or viruses – especially during a visual inspection: “It is impossible that inspectors have the knowledge of all diseases in all commodities.” Only a sample of about 2% of imported plants are inspected for the presence of symptoms, according to international protocols, says the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA). Given the number of plants that come through the main EU ports, it is “possible that new species will be introduced”. The NVWA says it believes the Netherlands has a robust control system. For example, once certain live plants pass the border and end up in a nursery, the phytosanitary inspector rechecks them after two weeks to see if they carry any latent disease. According to Van Ruiten, the burden of preventing disease shouldn’t fall entirely on the shoulders of the importers. He says exporting countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America should also conduct proper checks. In the port at Ravenna, phytosanitary inspector Solmi recognises the challenge. “Europe was born around the movement of goods, capital and people,” he says. “Our mission is to do our best within the open phytosanitary system because an alternative currently does not exist.” But while the economic cost of what the EU could lose in terms of trading is substantial, so is the price of the damages caused by alien pests and diseases. How do you put a price on a lost forest of ash trees? “The main issue on the economics is that data is kind of scarce,” says Françoise Petter, former assistant director at EPPO. The costs and benefits of a closed system have not been calculated, and it is unknown whether losses incurred by a slower trading system would be offset by the preserved value of EU agriculture and biodiversity. “We’ve never tried to do a full comparison with a closed system,” Petter says. “That’s a little bit depressing, isn’t it?” This article was developed with the support of Journalismfund Europe Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news and features\n",

      "Text: In the early 1990s, vultures across India started dying inexplicably. Long-billed, slender-billed and oriental white-backed vultures declined to the brink of extinction, with the number of India’s most common three vulture species falling by more than 97% between 1992 and 2007. Six other species were in sharp decline too. Scientists started testing the dead birds and worked out they had been exposed to diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory drug routinely given to cattle in south Asia at the time. The vultures fed on the carcasses of cows and were poisoned. That was the beginning of a far-reaching chain reaction. As vulture populations crashed, cow carcasses started to pile up, and the numbers of rats and wild dogs surged. Dogs became the main scavengers at dumps previously used by vultures. Data suggests that from 1992 to 2003, dogs increased by 7 million. The number of dog bites soared and rabies infections shot up, causing tens of thousands of people to die each year. In 2006, diclofenac was banned, and vulture populations have slowly started to recover. In the late 1950s, China’s leader, Mao Zedong, wanted to rapidly industrialise the country through the Great Leap Forward. That involved the “four pests campaign”, targeting mosquitoes, rats, flies – and sparrows. He ordered all the country’s sparrows to be killed because he thought they were feeding on rice and grains and reducing the amount available for people. Citizens were told to shoot the birds, tear down their nests, smash their eggs and bang pots so they would be scared into the sky and fall to their deaths, exhausted. Sparrows were nearly driven to extinction in China. What Mao’s officials didn’t realise is that sparrows rely on grains for only a small part of their diet: the bulk of it comprises insects. After the mass killing, there was an eruption of insect pests which destroyed the country’s crops. “This ecological catastrophe coupled with a multi-year drought and disastrous agricultural policies led to one of the most devastating famines in history. It is estimated that about 45 million people died,” says Prof Marc Cadotte, an ecologist at the University of Toronto. A deadly chytrid fungus called Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) ripped through Panama and Costa Rica from the 1980s to the mid-1990s, leading to the extinction of dozens of species of amphibians, with some scientists putting the number at 90. It was described as “the greatest loss of biodiversity attributable to a disease”, but most people would have been unaware of the tragedy. After the deaths, there was an eight-year spike in malaria cases in Central America, as mosquitoes thrived, probably because there were no frogs, salamanders and other amphibians to prey on their eggs, researchers reported recently. At its peak there was a fivefold increase in malaria cases. “If we allow massive ecosystem disruptions to happen, it can substantially impact human health in ways that are difficult to predict ahead of time and hard to control once they’re under way,” says Michael Springborn, a professor at the University of California, Davis, and lead author of the paper. In 2004, an Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami killed more than 230,000 people. The countries worst hit were Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand, all of which had experienced significant declines in mangrove cover, according to a report by the Environmental Justice Foundation. From 1980 to 2000, the area covered by mangroves in these countries fell by 28%. In places where the trees had been destroyed, the waves penetrated further inland, killing more people and aggravating the destruction of homes and livelihoods. The “mangrove forests played a crucial role in saving human lives and property”, the report said. Mangroves absorb the impact of waves and rising sea levels by their large root systems, which dissipate energy. “Conserving and restoring coastal mangrove areas is essential if coastal communities are to recover and be protected from similar events,” the report concluded. In Sichuan province, south-west China, the widespread use of pesticides alongside habitat destruction means that farmers have to carry pots of pollen to pollinate pear and apple trees themselves, according to Dave Goulson, professor of biology at the University of Sussex. This means using a paintbrush attached to a long bamboo pole to dab inside each flower. About 30% of China’s pear trees are artificially pollinated, according to one study. Pollinating insects are vital to human food security – three-quarters of crops depend on them. They are also crucial to other wildlife, as a source of food and as pollinators of wild plants. But a lack of wild pollinators is affecting food production around the world. In the US, researchers studied seven crops grown in 13 states and found that five showed evidence that a lack of bees is affecting the amount of food that can be grown, including apples, blueberries and cherries. Since the second world war, our main defence against crop pests has been artificial pesticides. But these chemicals also kill helpful insects, including parasitoid wasps, lacewings and ladybirds, which hunt common pests and provide support to farmers and gardeners. Researchers in Brazil have found that ants can be more effective than pesticides at helping farmers produce food because they are better at killing pests, reducing plant damage and increasing yields. This is because they are “generalist” predators, hunting pests that damage fruit, seeds and leaves. The scientists looked at the impact of 26 species of ants (mainly tree ants) on 17 crops, including citrus, mango, apple and soy. According to the paper, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, they do best in diversified farming systems, such as agroforestry and shade-grown crops because there are more places for them to nest. Like mangroves, coral reefs are a natural barrier to waves and storms. Because of their hard, jagged formations they can protect coastal communities and reduce the threat of erosion. They make it more likely for waves to break off-shore, reducing wave energy by an average of 97% by the time they hit land. It is estimated that nearly 200 million people in coastal areas around the world depend on the protection of coral reefs. Research shows that in the US they provide more than $1.8bn annually in flood protection benefits. However, developments such as marinas and docks, as well as pollution, damage these reefs. The corals are also being destroyed by rising temperatures, which lead to mass bleaching. Research suggests that virtually all corals on the planet will suffer from severe bleaching if global temperatures rise by 1.5C.

      "Text: George Monbiot makes a strong case for how our ecosystem might survive (Electric food – the new sci-fi diet that could save our planet, 31 October). He thinks it is imperative that we eliminate meat in favour of plant-based agriculture. He also wants us to explore the possibility of using electricity instead of photosynthesis to convert sunlight into food. Since this would be 10 times more efficient, farming and fishing need take up much less space and biodiversity could flourish. But I must protest at the absurdity of his claim that the destruction of forests and wetlands along with “the slaughter of predators and the massacre of turtles … is done at our behest”. The felling of rainforest in Brazil is no more done at my behest, even if (knowingly or unknowingly) I happen to buy toiletries or food containing palm oil, than is the laundering of dirty money because I have a mortgage with a high street bank. I don’t want to make the equally absurd claim that as individuals we have no responsibility for the environmentally damaging effects of many of our unavoidable choices. My point is, rather, that the range of choices, and what any one of them involves, is overwhelmingly determined by sociopolitical constraints. As individuals in a relatively free society, we can attempt to alter these constraints by starting or joining movements – like Extinction Rebellion, which Monbiot tells us has just been launched. Good luck to it.Richard BrydenLlandudno, Clwyd  There are fundamental reasons why the Solar Foods system can’t compete with plants for sustainable food production. The supply of minerals for the bacteria has to be assembled chemically, with all the chemical industry’s environmental downsides. By contrast, plant roots pull the right minerals in the right proportions out of mixed-up traces in the environment, using solar energy to fuel selective concentration at no cost, generating no pollution. The machinery to acquire the raw materials is built by the plant using solar energy in a non-polluting process, not made in a factory. Likewise, the light energy-trapping machinery of plants is assembled on a planetary scale with none of the unwelcome byproducts of heat and chemical pollution associated with solar cell fabrication. Plants are still the only source of food with long-term sustainability.David HankeSwaffham Bulbeck, Cambridgeshire  Given the warning from the IPCC of imminent catastrophic planetary systems’ collapse, George Monbiot’s piece is apposite. Novel synthesis based on hydrogen, the simplest element, opens up a whole new world of possibilities that might just save the world. Hydrogen, produced from water by electrolysis using renewable energy, is already set to replace fossil fuels in transport vehicles via the hydrogen fuel cell. Now it appears we can substantially ease the ecological burden the world population – especially the rich world – places on our planet by replacing our food sources with hydrogen-based nutrition. It’s not alchemy, it’s better. It actually works!John StoneThames Ditton, Surrey  Much as I love George Monbiot, I find his suggestion this week unacceptable. Human history has been one of population growth, and “helpful” people have been offering technological solutions to feeding the growing masses. From farming and industrialisation to big pharma and changing eating habits, everything is designed to maintain the human population. Only when we accept death and learn to love our predators can we achieve sustainability.Susan HitchcockEastbourne, East Sussex  I see George Monbiot is again indulging in magical thinking. Leaving aside all the issues in turning something from a laboratory curiosity to a viable food source, his greatest error is overlooking the fact that – in the unlikely event of this becoming a food source – the intellectual property involved would undoubtedly end up in the hands of big business, which would ensure it was used to enhance their profits at the expense of general benefit.Jeff TaylorDitchling, East Sussex  Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com  Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters  Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

      "Text: The publication of the government's climate change strategy tomorrow should herald the beginning of a new era in the fight against climate change. While the public-facing, energy-saving policies may catch the headlines, what is going on behind the scenes is in reality more important. In order to meet the requirement of the Climate Change Act, and the carbon budgets it created, the government has had to adopt a new approach to managing carbon. In this new regime every tonne counts and all government departments with an influence over policies affecting emissions will need to play their part in keeping reductions on track. The mechanics of how this will work are not yet clear but it is certain that climate change is now a shared responsibility across the entire government. Departments falling behind will need to take corrective action or face the consequences, which could mean finding money to pay for emissions reductions in other parts of the world. This should serve to focus the minds of ministers and permanent secretaries. When Friends of the Earth wrote the first report advocating carbon budgets in 2005, which I co-authored, we were seeking to cause exactly this kind of change in the government's attitude to climate change policy. We wanted them to adopt a more holistic approach that took into account the effect of all policies, not just the limited climate-specific policies it had introduced, and also, importantly, the trends that were causing emissions to rise, where often there were no policies in place to counter them. The principle behind carbon budgeting is simply that emissions must stay within a pre-determined limit or compensating actions, such as payment for emission reductions elsewhere, must be taken. This was meant to engender the feeling that every tonne counts, since allowing an emission to take place creates a liability against the budget, whereas, investing in emissions savings effectively creates an asset. This was intended to force the government to think long term and to break the deadlock that the Treasury then had on climate policy, by expressing the problem in a language they understood. In other areas of public life the principle of borrowing to invest in long-term projects was accepted but, when it came to climate, the mantra was keep it cheap, which led to an over-reliance on emissions trading to deliver the cheapest possible short-term solutions anywhere in the world. With a clear framework dictating that emissions must, one way or another, go down, the smart minds in the Treasury can now apply themselves to working out how to uncover emissions savings in Britain for less than it would cost to keep buying them overseas. This shouldn't be difficult as we've really only just got started and there is still plenty of low-hanging fruit. They will also quickly work out that it is far more sensible to invest at home rather than allowing cash continually to flow overseas, at a time when we need all the inward investment we can get. Increasing the efficiency with which we use energy and reduce wastage are both obvious candidates when it comes to low-cost solutions. Improving our building stock can also help to counteract rises in energy costs so it should be no surprise that these policies take centre stage in the government's strategy. Looking longer term it is clear that to get to a zero carbon Britain we will have to start by creating a zero carbon electricity system. Clean electricity, as opposed to the high-coal variety we currently use, can then be used to replace the fossil fuels we use to heat our homes and power our vehicles. These are not radical new ideas – these aren't needed just yet – but they're not necessarily straightforward to achieve either. The government still needs to create a clear plan and to harness the power of the private sector to deliver its vision cost effectively. It also needs the buy-in of the public to do their part in embracing the changes we need to go through. Tomorrow's publications should give us the first iteration of that plan – policies will not be written in stone and will no doubt flex and change as departments work out what works, and what doesn't, when it comes to staying within budget. But this could be the dawn of the first comprehensive, concerted attempt to tackle the problem of climate change – let's hope it works.\n",

      "Text: If you want to appreciate the prairie landscape that inspired President Theodore Roosevelt to set aside 230m acres as national land, you have to pull off the interstate somewhere in the Dakotas, or in the eastern third of Montana, Wyoming, or Colorado. Follow a dirt road for a few miles, roll down your windows, and shut off your engine. Do this almost any time of day, preferably in springtime. Above and below ground, the prairies are humming with life: birds, rodents, snakes, pronghorn, badgers and coyotes, rioting amid a landscape of grass and sagebrush. A patchwork of public land comprises large blocs of this splendid and sparsely populated terrain, and while much public ground has the appearance of a nature preserve, it is mostly a working landscape. Public forage, timber, and water resources sustain thriving wildlife populations, along with millions of livestock and thousands of agricultural producers. For these people and their communities, public land isn’t a destination on a bucket list, a recreational playground, or a studio for Instagrammers – it’s a source of life to which they’re intimately connected. That’s why many ranchers are unnerved by the Republican party’s land transfer agenda, which aims to give away as much federal public land as possible to the states. While the movement gains traction among the Republican cadre, its attractiveness to rural westerners is less certain, and if it ever succeeds, it will mean a radical restructuring of the foundations of the economy and the culture of the west. There is a hardcore element within the growing land transfer movement, represented most garishly by the Bundy clan from the Mormon stronghold of Bunkerville, Nevada, who owe more than $1m in unpaid federal grazing fees, and who blackened the image of anyone with a cowboy hat when they staged an armed takeover of a national wildlife refuge in Oregon last year. The Bundys and their acolytes don’t believe the federal government has the right to own any land aside from military bases, but their militant, extremist position is a sideshow. The most powerful champions of land transfer wear business suits and woo industry and urban conservatives with a simple pitch: states understand their own resources better than the feds, and they’d do a better job of managing timber, livestock, petroleum, and mining leases for the benefit of the state economy and local communities. For several years, the Utah congressman Rob Bishop, chairman of the House natural resources committee, and the lobbyists attached to the American Lands Council (ALC), a not-for-profit group founded by the Utah state representative Ken Ivory, have been preaching the land transfer gospel. In July 2016, they won a major victory when the GOP officially added the land transfer agenda to the party platform. This happened despite an astonishing lack of research demonstrating that transferring land to the states would benefit anyone, industry included. And if money tells us anything, it’s that ranchers aren’t much of a consideration in the land transfer movement. The ALC is registered as a 501(c)4 not-for-profit organization, which means it is not required to share donor details, but it has been established that substantial funding comes from the billionaire Koch brothers, who are heavily involved in the petrochemical industry and openly committed to destroying the environmental regulatory apparatus. In the ALC’s marketing videos, Ivory enumerates the many ways in which environmental regulations and bureaucratic red tape prevent states from maximizing revenue from oil and gas, mining, and timber development. I reached out to the ALC’s headquarters, to ask how they expected land transfer to affect agricultural communities, but received no response. Even though agriculture is a key economic driver throughout the western states, Ivory and his fellow land transfer advocates barely pay lip service to ranchers. It’s not as if all is rosy on the range. Spend a half hour talking with a public land rancher in the west, and you’re likely to hear an earful about how the federal government’s regulatory straightjacket limits their ability to do what’s best for the land and for their businesses. Many ranchers are frustrated by litigation brought by environmental groups over alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, which they say results in burdensome regulations that keep federal land agency officers tied up with paperwork instead of focused on rangeland management. Sage grouse – large, ground-dwelling members of the family that includes quail and partridge – are the rangeland management controversy du jour in Montana, where I live. In some instances, measures designed to boost grouse numbers have forced ranchers to reduce or eliminate grazing on public pastures they’ve used for decades. In other cases, they’ve been unable to implement noxious weed control and fire prevention measures, which they claim has made sagebrush habitat more prone to destructive fires and less healthy for wildlife and livestock. The same federal government helped restore the gray wolf to the northern Rockies and is still protecting a population of grizzly bears that has outstripped its government recovery goals. While environmental groups cheer the return of wild carnivores, ranchers in predator country worry about their calves and lambs becoming the next meal. None of these actions, however justified, have endeared the federal government to the western ranching community, which is overwhelmingly conservative and Republican. And yet, not one of the dozen or so ranchers I have talked to thinks that any of these headaches merit transferring federal land to the states. Quite the opposite: they all tell me that transfer to the states would create a maelstrom of uncertainty for their businesses. In the worst case, they say that transfer would push their communities, and their way of life, closer to the brink of extinction. There are about 22,000 public land ranchers in the west who hold grazing leases on about 250m acres of federal rangeland. They occupy a tenuous space in a livestock market dominated by huge corporate outfits in Texas, Oklahoma, and the midwestern states, and they often survive in challenging environments where short growing seasons, scarce water, and extreme temperatures and terrain are the norm. With all the variables at play – from increasingly unpredictable weather to fluctuating beef prices – there isn’t much margin for error in their financial planning. According to Jim Hagenbarth, 68, who owns a ranch with his brother Dave that spans the Montana-Idaho border and which has been in his family since the 1930s, land transfer advocates have not adequately addressed how state agencies would avoid destroying the grazing lease fee structure, which has been a bedrock of stability for western ranchers since the Great Depression. Under federal lease programs established in the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934, stockgrowers pay a monthly fee of less than $2 for each animal that they turn out on to leased ground during the summer and autumn months. Grazing fees on state land are as much as 20 times higher, and they vary from year to year based on several factors, including the market cost of beef. If ranchers with large federal leases were suddenly forced to pay state fees, Hagenbarth said, many of them would go under, and the resources and the wildlife they support would suffer in their absence. In addition to fees, ranchers take on out-of-pocket expenses to develop water, maintain fences, and fight weeds. “Weeds are the greatest threat to public land in the west,” he said. According to Hagenbarth’s calculations, those costs averaged $30 per animal over five years. “It costs one hell of a lot of money to do a good job. We don’t just turn the cows out and let ’em tear the hell out of it. We spray a lot of weeds,” he said. “It’s now to the point that the federal government should be paying you to graze the land, with all the costs we have to manage it.” In early May, Hagenbarth took me on a tour of several of the family’s pastures outside of Dillon, Montana, sandwiched between the Madison and Centennial mountain ranges, which still held snow almost down to the tree line. It was the peak of the spring “green-up”, when seasonal grasses flourish before going dormant and fading to a tawny gold. Herds of pronghorn grazed amid small clusters of black angus cattle. Mating pairs of mallard ducks swam in a watering hole that Hagenbarth built, and curved-billed curlews stalked the marshy banks on stilt-like legs. Hagenbarth, who graduated from Notre Dame University, where he played rugby, pointed out various strains of grasses – blue grama, needle-and-thread, Bozoisky, Vavilov – and explained the ways he and his family were trying to improve rangeland health, from new approaches to grazing rotation designed to protect riparian areas and stimulate grass growth, to weed management, to attempts to restore native grasses and reverse the legacy of Dust Bowl erosion that still haunts his pastures. His face, shaded by a wide-brimmed straw hat, was covered in ruby blotches – a side-effect of a preventive treatment for skin cancer. Hagenbarth’s tanned, gnarled hands, like his face, are a testament to a life spent in the sun. According to him, if transfer were to force ranchers off the range, the loss to western landscapes and communities would go beyond the disappearance of ranchers and their livestock, something that some environmental groups, like the Center for Biological Diversity, actively seek. “You need livestock, which do what the big bison herds did when you had the wolves and the Indians moving them around. You have to have some kind of grazing disturbance to keep the ecosystem healthy, but the American people don’t understand that,” he explained. Ranchers’ knowledge of the land they work on a daily basis – public and private – is also invaluable, according to Hagenbarth. “I’ve been here 68 years, and I know this place by the individual tree and the fish in a specific hole in the creek. Over a lifetime, you develop a land ethic for a piece of ground and you have a responsibility to manage it for society using the tools that nature gave you – from hoof pressure to grazing and fire.” Vicki Olson, 63, owns a ranch with her sister, Nancy Ereaux, 54, and their husbands, near the Canadian border in north-central Montana, on ground her Basque sheepherder ancestors homesteaded over a hundred years ago. She shares Hagenbarth’s concerns. Like most ranches in the semi-arid Missouri River Breaks region of north-central Montana, the Olson-Ereaux operation depends on large public grazing leases. Olson worries about what state ownership would mean for the cost of goods, determined by the expenses that go into delivering a full-grown animal to market. “Right now … you can’t lose that lease unless you abuse it or don’t pay, so we have a kind of guarantee there,” Olson explained. The promise of multi-generational leases gives ranching families everywhere the incentive to treat public pasture as their own. Interestingly, one of the biggest complaints ranchers make about land management agencies is that they are understaffed and underfunded, which means agents don’t have nearly enough time to make the rounds to local ranches. That not only reduces the two-way flow of beneficial information about management practices, but also allows negligent leaseholders to get away with damaging the range. In general, though, Olson said most ranchers wanted to turn over their property and its adjoining leases to kids or close relatives, and to maximize its productivity to ensure high resale value. Whether planning for a sale or for the next generation’s inheritance, investing for the long-term health of public and private rangeland is just good business sense. In contrast to the federal lease system, Montana state leases are 10-year contracts awarded to the highest bidder. “Someone can come in and bid you way up, and then they can withdraw, and they don’t have to meet that bid, and you’re stuck with it ... That would be really hard on ranchers,” Olson said, sitting on the porch of her modest ranch house, a couple hundred yards from the red-roofed homesteader cabin in which she grew up. In tough times, or when people don’t expect to hold on to a piece of ground, they try to get as much out of the resource as possible in the shortest amount of time. And since the Taylor Grazing Act’s rangeland protections don’t apply on state ground, there is no regulatory mechanism to prevent abuse. “What the state will find is that someone will come in and bid way up on it, farm the ever-loving heck out of it, trash it, and then turn it back.” Chris Mehl, the policy director of Headwaters Economics, a Bozeman-based research firm, told me that the concerns of ranchers like Hagenbarth and Olson were entirely valid. “All state lands in the west other than state parks have a mandate to be utilized to maximize return,” he explained. That means a rancher could be kicked off a piece of ground if the state couldn’t demonstrate profitability from the lease, or if there were a promise of a higher return from another activity. In the event that a piece of state land didn’t cash-flow, the state would be legally obligated to sell it – a worst-case scenario that would open the door to massive development. By contrast, the multiple-use mandate of the federal land management agencies means no user group claims priority, and there is no requirement for federal lands to remain in the black. Land transfer advocates claim state ownership would be better for business, but Mehl disagrees: “We look at rural western counties, and the ones with a high percentage of federal lands are outperforming the ones that don’t have it.” Additionally, Mehl said, “there are enormous costs that would be incurred by states, and, in almost all of them, you’re not allowed to deficit spend, which the federal government does every year regardless of who’s in power.” Those costs would include hiring thousands of personnel to fill the roles of federal range managers, research scientists, law enforcement, and all the staff who support them, not to mention the unfathomable expense of fighting wildfires. Wildfire management alone currently costs the federal government over $3bn annually and amounts to roughly half of the US Forest Service budget. How would western states, which are already facing budget shortfalls, suddenly generate revenue for additional hundreds of millions of dollars worth of expenses? Ethan Lane, the executive director of the Public Lands Council, a project of the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, which represents stockgrowers who hold public land grazing permits, told me: “Wholesale transfer of public lands could have a tremendously destabilizing effect on the western cattle industry.” If state land were ever to go up for auction, Lane said, it’s unlikely ranchers in areas with high scenic and recreational values would be able to compete with real estate developers. Subdivisions and trophy homes would replace production agriculture in places like the Big Hole Valley, where Hagenbarth lives, which boast the sort of mountain views and that millionaires drool over. Jay Bodner, the natural resources director of the Montana Stockgrowers Association, which represents about 2,000 ranchers across the state, told me that his organization’s current position is that ranchers would be “better off trying to work with [federal] agencies” to solve management problems. “There are complexities with a lot of these issues, and by simply moving them from federal to state – those complexities will still be on the landscape,” he said. Across Montana’s southern border, Jim Magagna, executive vice-president of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association, told me something similar. “We have not come out in favor of the transfer. We have not opposed it. But we’re certainly not advocates for it.” Leo Barthelmess, a sheep rancher, former director of the Montana Stockgrowers and neighbor of Vicki Olson, put it more simply: “We’d just be exchanging one landlord for another.” From the perspective of the public land rancher, the economic case against land transfer seems clear enough, at least in the context of my home state of Montana, where public land comprises almost 40% of the state’s land mass. But the more time I spent with ranchers on both sides of the political aisle, in various parts of the state, the more I began to wonder if the focus on economics might be a distraction from the cultural and ecological arguments for keeping ranchers and livestock on public land. When I visited Vicki Olson and her husband, Darryl, 65, at their ranch in early May, Vicki asked me if I was interested in attending a calf branding the following morning. She gave me directions to the French Ranch that didn’t include any road names, but consisted instead of phrases like, “When you see the old church on top of the hill, turn left at the next dirt road,” and, “It’ll be the only turnoff that looks like it’s been recently used after you cross the creek.” I camped for free that night on a patch of Bureau of Land Management ground beside a stock pond. A crowd of people showed up the following morning to help Bill and Corky French, their son and daughter-in-law Craig and Conni, and their grandson Wayne brand more than 600 calves. About 25 friends, relatives, and community members, including a local schoolteacher and a BLM employee from the local office, pitched in throughout the day, stopping every so often for a cookie or a cup of coffee. What at first appeared to be mayhem was actually skillfully executed teamwork that required almost no direction. Men and women on horseback lassoed calves by the hind feet and dragged them to the center of the corral, where they were quickly tackled to the ground by teams of two, restrained, inoculated, branded, and castrated. There was no distinction between men’s and women’s work, and everyone from grade school kids to grandparents seemed happy to pitch in and help. Some folks had traveled from hours away. By the end of the day, close to sunset, I was totally worn out. Craig French’s mother, Cork, had prepared a feast of barbecue, potato salad, and fresh-baked pies, which she served in an old camper trailer parked at the entrance of the pasture. “We’ll be doing this every weekend for the next month or so,” Olson told me. She said that she and Darryl regularly helped friends who live as far as 30 miles away, and that they wouldn’t be able to survive without the help of others. “If your neighbor thinks you need something, they supply it without being asked,” she said. In addition to helping with brandings, community members go in together on expensive equipment and help each other trailer stock to auction. When Olson’s aunt died in the middle of this year’s calving season, neighbors checked on their heifers day and night while the Olsons attended to family business. “I think we have a pretty unique community,” she told me. I thought about a conversation I’d had with Ralph Maughan, a member of the Board of Directors of the Western Watersheds Project (WWP), a conservation group firmly opposed to public land grazing. Years before, I’d spoken to Maughan – a retired political science professor – for a story I was working on about wolves, and I had appreciated his insights. The gist of the WWP’s position on public land ranchers was their output represents a minuscule fraction of US beef production, and they do more widespread and lasting damage to public land than any other user group. If public land ranchers were to disappear entirely, Maughan said, they would not be missed by the broader cattle industry, and it would be better for wildlife and rangeland habitat. In the aggregate, I couldn’t really argue with Maughan’s broader logic – perhaps it was true that most public land grazing allotments occupied ground that would be better off without livestock, like the cholla and saguaro deserts of Arizona and the Great Basin of Wyoming. At the same time, the argument seemed to denigrate the place of ranchers on public land. Here was a group advocating for termination by legislative fiat of an embattled, marginal community, and one with a strong culture based in a traditional livelihood that was more or less sustainable. I ran Maughan’s comments past Dave Pyke, a research ecologist with three decades of experience who works for the US Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center in Corvallis, Oregon. Pyke said that arid and semi-arid ecosystems where there is no history of large ungulates would probably do better without any grazing pressure, but that in areas where bison herds once roamed and grasses have adapted, there is a body of evidence that properly managed livestock grazing provides ecological benefits. In addition, removing livestock from areas where ranchers have become part of the solution to eliminating noxious weeds might also be ruinous – even if it was those same livestock who spread the weeds in the first place. Brian Martin of the Montana office of the Nature Conservancy agrees. “Ranchers are a key partner because they’re interested in a lot of the same outcomes as the conservation community. At the end of the day, we want to keep intact habitat that supports the full complement of wildlife species, and we’re able to use that livestock grazing as a way to manage and manipulate habitat conditions.” Darcie Warden, of the Bozeman-based Greater Yellowstone Coalition, told me that her organization also sees ranchers as vital to the future of habitat and wildlife conservation. “You know the saying: cows, not condos. In some places that doesn’t apply, but out here it does. This is a sought-out location by a lot of people and there’s a lot of money, and if we lose those working ranch lands, we are going to see a fragmented landscape.” On the morning I sat with Vicki Olson on her porch, she seemed cheerful, even as she described her sense that the walls were closing in. Life on the range has never been easy, and as far as Olson is concerned, the land transfer threat is just the latest in a string of attempts to push ranchers off the land. The only thing unique about it is that it’s coming from the right. “Honestly, I don’t think it’s going to happen, but that was before this administration,” Olson said, referring to the election of Donald Trump. When I asked Olson who she thinks is representing the interests of her community in Washington, she said: “Well, Liz Cheney out of Wyoming, and Rob Bishop out of Utah.” I asked her if she knew that Rob Bishop was the chief advocate of the land transfer agenda in Congress, and she looked stunned. “No, I didn’t know that,” she said. “That really surprises me.” I asked Olson where she thought the ranch and the adjacent public land would be in 50 years. “I hope it’s still in agriculture,” she said, although she said she wasn’t sure either of her two children would ever take over the ranch. Her daughter, Michelle, owns a ranch with her husband in South Dakota, and her son, Jason, lives in the Bitterroot Valley, on the other side of the state. “He’s interested in the ranch, but we’re not ready to retire and we can’t afford to hire another person,” Olson told me. “Besides, when you love what you do, you don’t need to retire. That’s what my dad always said, and he was out here feeding cattle till the day he died.\n",

      "Text: Symbol of Easter and scourge of Mr McGregor, the rabbit may be the cute hero of children’s books but its rapid reproduction has traditionally made it a pest for farmers and gardeners. Now, however, with British rabbit populations are being decimated by disease, the humble bunny is being hailed as an “ecosystem engineer” and landowners encouraged to create innovative “rabbit hotels” to revive its numbers. The hotels – piles of branches artfully arranged near existing rabbit warrens – provide safety from burgeoning predators, and new places for female rabbits to burrow and give birth to their kits. The brash piles are the key technique in a new “toolkit” successfully trialled in five locations as part of Shifting Sands, a four-year National Heritage lottery-funded project to restore rare species in the East Anglian Brecks. Rabbit numbers decreased by 88% in the east Midlands and 83% in Scotland between 1996 and 2018. They fell 43% across the whole of the UK over the decade to 2018, with the latest scientific survey recording no sign of the declines slowing. “Rabbits are in a lot of trouble,” said Pip Mountjoy, Shifting Sands project manager at Natural England. “They are actually an endangered species in their native region on the Iberian peninsula. It’s surprising for people that rabbits are important in some ecosystems. We think of them as a pest but in Britain they are a keystone species – they act as landscape managers and a lot of other species rely on them.” Shifting Sands is part of the Back from the Brink species-rescue effort. The European rabbit is not native to the UK but was brought here by the Normans. For nearly nine centuries they were intensively farmed for meat on the Brecks. In this unique dry, sandy biodiversity hotspot, their grazing helped rare plants and invertebrates thrive. Rabbits are selective grazers, and keep vigorous grasses in check, thereby assisting more delicate wildflowers. The animal’s earth-scratching and burrowing helps seeds germinate and creates what ecologists call “mini mosaic habitat” – patches of warm, bare earth which are havens for rare flowers and invertebrates, as well as the common lizards and adders that bask there. Rare plants assisted by rabbit grazing include purple milk vetch, rare spring sedge, spring speedwell, and prostrate perennial knawel, which is found nowhere in the world outside Breckland. The caterpillars of the declining lunar yellow underwing moth are found close to rabbit burrows and even endangered birds are helped: rabbits unearth lots of flints from the sandy soil which provide perfect camouflage for the stone curlew, which lays its flint-coloured eggs on the ground. Myxomatosis introduced into Britain in the 1950s was allowed to spread and reduce rabbit populations by 99%. While many crop-growers were pleased, the rapid loss of wild rabbits and their grazing contributed to the extinction of the large blue butterfly in 1979 (since reintroduced) and near-loss of other species that require warm, closely cropped grassland. Rabbit populations revived when individuals developed resistance to myxomatosis but a new virus, rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus type 2 (RHDV2), has caused a second crash in Britain’s rabbit population since it emerged in commercial rabbit farms in northern France in 2010. Diana Bell, professor of conservation biology at the University of East Anglia, a partner in the Shifting Sands project, has studied the impact of RHDV2 on the large rabbit warrens on her university campus. “This virus has decimated rabbit populations – they’ve just crashed everywhere, and the virus keeps coming back,” she said. “It’s become endemic like myxomatosis. Even now we still don’t see baby rabbits by the side of the road as we used to.” The virus can kill rabbits at a young age, and a typical sight are baby rabbits, or kits, sat motionless at the entrance to a hole. The earlier variant, RHD1, caused bleeding from the nose but this virus often has no visible signs. When dead animals are subject to postmortem, major haemorrhaging has been found in their livers and organs. Myxomatosis still kills rabbits as well. “When you’ve got two completely different viruses attacking them at different stages in different ways I don’t think we will ever see rabbits back in the numbers they once were,” said Bell. Under her guidance, the Shifting Sands project has trialled techniques to boost rabbit populations where family groups are clinging on. “Rabbit habitat enhancement plots” – or rabbit hotels – are built to provide refuges for rabbits to hide from aerial predators such as buzzards and create “stepping stones” to help them hop through the landscape. But the rabbit hotels have another function. Bell’s research has revealed that rabbits live in matriarchal family groups, with a dominant female assisted by daughters, nieces, aunties, grandmothers and great-grandmothers. The dominant female prevents other females from having kits – sometimes even dragging a rival’s babies above ground to die – because too many young around a warren attracts predators including foxes, badgers, stoats and polecats. The hotels provide space where subordinate females can safely have babies, so helping rabbits breed like rabbits again. Monthly monitoring by volunteers from Natural England and Suffolk and Norfolk wildlife trusts found 41% of the brash piles contained rabbit burrows – which usually leads to breeding – and 91% contained scrapes – evidence of use by rabbits. The Shifting Sands project also used diggers to create artificial banks for rabbits to burrow and breed, as originally deployed by the warreners who bred rabbits in the Brecks. But researchers found the brash piles were more effective and cheaper to construct. The findings have gone into a toolkit, which is now being given to other landowners to boost rabbit populations. “We’re hoping this toolkit can be used across the UK because it’s a national problem,” said Mountjoy. Even though the rabbit is still classified as a costly, invasive pest by some studies, Mountjoy said it had not been difficult to persuade landowners to learn to love it, with one of 10 project partners being the Elveden Estate, a major vegetable grower. “It’s definitely true that a rabbit on cropland or a golfing green is a pest,” said Mountjoy, “but the landowners are overwhelmingly on board. We’ve had a really positive response.” Private landowners and conservation charities who own lowland heaths and grassland that are designated sites of special scientific interest are often required to maintain “open, disturbed conditions” on the site. “You can either get mechanical disturbance with a digger and pay for it or you can get it for free with rabbits, so landowners and rabbits aren’t at odds in the way that you might imagine,” said Mountjoy. Where Peter Rabbit-style vegetable theft has proved problematic, non-lethal deterrents such as rabbit-proof fencing can be used, according to Mountjoy, although she said rabbit populations were so low in many locations now that they simply were not the problem they once were. She added: “There’s little we can do to tackle the virus but these works will provide a lifeline to populations and help them deal with the threats that are coming in from all directions.” Wild Green Wonders by Patrick Barkham (Guardian Faber, £14.99).

The Global Partnership for Oceans, a coalition of governments, NGOs, scientists and businesses, is a political boost for the world's overfished, heavily polluted and increasingly warming oceans. More controversially it proposes the expansion of aquaculture (farmed fish) to provide two-thirds of the world's fish, up from half today, to alleviate pressure on wild fish as a growing human population increasingly looks to the sea for protein. Unveiling the plan, the World Bank president, Robert Zoellick, warned that marine ecosystems, which cover more than 70% of the surface of the planet, have deteriorated to a perilous level. \"The world's oceans are in danger, and the enormity of the challenge is bigger than one country or organisation. We need co-ordinated global action to restore our oceans to health,\" he told the Economist's World Ocean Summit in Singapore. The alliance brings together many nations and organisations that are already attempting to alleviate what is, after the climate, the ultimate \"tragedy of the commons\" – the running down of resources that are largely owned by no one, exploited by anyone and woefully unregulated. Among the confirmed backers are small island states, many leading conservation organisations – including Conservation International, WWF, the Nature Conservancy, and business groups commited to sustainable practices. The World Bank is also in discussion with with other potential supporters, including the Prince's Trust and the governments of Australia, Monaco, New Zealand, and Norway. But the success or failure of the partnership is likely to be determined by its ability to find funding and reach out to leading economies in Europe, North American and big developing nations, such as China, India, Indonesia and Brazil, where increasingly affluent and large populations are looking to the oceans for more protein, energy and minerals. Many are reluctant to accept protection measures that might constrain opportunities to exploit these resources. Zoellick – who is approaching the end of his tenure at the World Bank – says the first step is promoting greater awareness of the value of oceans – for example, in absorbing carbon dioxide and regulating weather patterns – and then helping governments to incorporate this in their policies. \"Oceans are the home of an under-recognised and underappreciated 'blue economy',\" he said. But he still needs to find the money to push this initiative. The partnership is committed to mobilising at least $300m in catalytic finance and aims to use that to leverage another $1.2bn from businesses, NGOs and other institutions.\n",

      "Text: The head of the Environment Agency has called for the government to reinstate a £120m grant to help increase surveillance of water companies and cut pollution in rivers. Sir James Bevan, the chief executive of the agency, told MPs that water companies and the farming industry, the two main polluters of rivers, were not doing enough to protect the environment. Cuts to the agency budget of nearly two-thirds since 2010 mean it would take staff 200 years to visit every farm in Britain. The limited resources have also affected monitoring of water companies and their discharges of raw sewage into rivers. “It is having an effect on our ability to know what is going on and to act effectively,” Bevan said. Bevan told MPs on the environmental audit committee that the government grant to the agency had been cut from £120m in 2010 to £40m last year. “I would like to see that grant restored,” he said. “I would like to get to a point where we were 10 years ago. That would make a massive difference in terms of people and hardware to monitor. I would like to do more surveillance of water companies.” Due to the funding cuts the agency had only a couple of hundred people dedicated to inspecting and monitoring discharges and pollution by water companies, he said. Bevan said his staff made about 9,000 inspections a year. But Philip Dunne, the chair of the environmental audit committee, pointed out that there were about 15,000 combined sewer overflows – which discharge raw sewage into rivers after heavy rainfall. “So you are inspecting just over half of the sites once a year,” said Dunne. Bevan said his agency believed that storm overflows were spilling raw sewage more frequently into rivers. “We think that over the last several decades these CSOs [combined sewer overflows], which are designed to overflow when there is heavy rain … are spilling more frequently and spilling larger volumes. That is likely to be because there is more development, more people and more sewage and because of climate change causing violent weather, more rain and heavier rain.” Latest data revealed that the nine English water companies discharged raw sewage into rivers more than 400,000 times over 3.1m hours in 2020. Bevan said the latest report on the performance of English water companies, likely to be published next month, would show some improvement, including the lowest number of serious pollution incidents. But he said: “Not every water company is doing well. Some of them are doing extremely badly and it is not good enough.” The Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, asked why data, presented to the committee by Prof Peter Hammond, showed that the number of illegal spills by water companies were more than 10 times greater than the number of agency prosecutions. “We take seriously his evidence,” he said. “We do need to check out reports of serious violations when we have good reason to believe those have happened or if there was deliberate culpability or serious environmental harm. I am sure that there are spills from CSOs that neither we nor frankly the water companies are always aware of and we are working with them to ensure better monitoring.” Lucas asked whether he had the resources to follow up. “Do we have the resources to do all we want to? No,” he said. “Resources are a factor. We do not have as much resource as we used to and that is having an effect on our ability to understand what is going on and to take action.” Bevan said he would like to see eye-watering fines for water companies which would make their boards take notice.\n",

There are many environmentalists who don’t feel such massive industrialisation of our land and seascapes is necessary. Insulting anyone who opposes ugly and often highly profitable developments in the name of progress by calling them nimbys has a long history – those fighting to save Covent Garden from demolition, Welsh mining communities opposing windfarms, communities saving swathes of east London from elevated motorways, and in Brighton it was local people who rejected the wholesale demolition of now thriving neighbourhoods through the creation of conservation areas. As Joni Mitchell said, “You don’t know what you’ve got till its gone”.

While Polly Toynbee, also rightly, excoriates the Cameron administration for shredding progress towards renewable energy, she complains that “local protesters … fight large solar farms”.

      "Text: In under a fortnight's time, the prime minister's aspiration to make his government \"the greenest ever\", may effectively be stuffed in the bin. On Monday, the fate of green organisations that save money for businesses and the public sector will be decided as part of George Obsorne's \"bonfire of the quangos\". Then, in the 20 October spending review, we will hear whether vital policies to help transform the UK into a low-carbon economy will survive intact. At the Conservative and Liberal Democrat party conferences we heard some fighting talk about tackling climate change. Now we need to see whether the government can deliver. Green spending can help put us on the road to economic recovery by creating jobs, supporting new technologies and businesses and slashing energy waste. The prize is worth winning – the government predicts a low-carbon and environmental sector worth £150bn by 2015, with 400,000 extra jobs – but only if it continues to be nurtured. Insulating homes would save the NHS money – £859m is spent treating winter-related illnesses due to poorly heated houses. Is David Cameron fully aware of how Treasury decisions will impact on his environmental ambitions? It seems the Treasury simply does not get the long-term job and taxable revenue creation potential of a green economy. The Carbon Trust, up for review on Monday, has already saved businesses £2.6bn in energy bills. It uses small amounts of public funds to attract massive private capital into the low-carbon technology sector: £2bn to date. The Environment Agency and Wrap both play a crucial role in tackling the UK's waste mountain and boosting recycling. We throw away around £650m of recyclable materials each year. Helping people recycle more and increasing targets to 70% could create 50,000 jobs and unlock the wealth in our waste. The Labour government was far from perfect on climate change. But towards the end it began laying the foundation for a green economy. By casting doubt on the future of many green organisations and policies, the coalition is throwing British firms' investment calculations into disarray and damaging the fledgling renewable and energy efficiency sector that should be driving our economic recovery. Some of these measures may sound dull. But, like the parts beneath a car's bonnet, they are critical to get you where you want to go. In April, the previous government introduced feed-in tariffs, financially rewarding homeowners, businesses and local authorities who generate electricity from clean, green sources. A heating equivalent – the renewable heat incentive (RHI) – is due to begin next April. Now the RHI may be delayed or watered down and the feed-in tariff cut. This is absurd. In Germany a similar policy created hundreds of thousands of jobs and the rapid growth of a now core economic sector. It would be incredibly short-sighted for the Treasury to backpedal on these commitments. Damaging investor confidence would ultimately make it more expensive to meet our renewable energy targets. And as fossil fuels dwindle and prices rocket, business leaders agree we should be doing everything we can to produce more renewable energy. The Labour government also announced a Green Investment Bank to lure in essential private investment in low-carbon technologies. And they set aside £60m to upgrade ports so the UK can become a manufacturing base for wind turbines. While the coalition has committed to a green bank in principle, its suggestions on funding it are derisory given the scale of need. And it has gone worryingly silent on port investment, with news yesterday suggesting the upgrades are for the axe. Lack of government guarantee on both counts is sending entirely the wrong message to investors, who will choose other countries offering a more attractive deal. To really work, the Green Investment Bank needs at least £6bn over the next four years. The energy and climate secretary, Chris Huhne, is pushing ahead with a \"green deal\" that encourages people to make homes energy efficient, slashing fuel bills and tackling climate change at the same time. This is promising, but the devil is in the detail. We need legislation to compel private landlords to bring the worst housing up to a minimum standard. The Treasury announcements on Monday and on 20 October will be the litmus test of how green this government is. Unless these doubts are cleared up, investors will walk away and our 2020 climate change targets will be even more difficult and expensive to achieve. This would be a tragedy for the UK, undermining our chance to seriously compete in the renewable market and hindering communities from producing their own energy – costing vital jobs in the process. For a self-styled green government advocating localism and the power of private enterprise, that would be an own goal of epic proportions. Greenest government ever? Ask me on 21 October.

      "Text: Shenzhen is set to become the first city in mainland China to ban the eating of dogs and cats, if a draft regulation released by the municipal government in a wider push to restrict the consumption of wild animals is approved. On Monday, China’s National People’s Congress issued an order to ban all consumption of wild animal meat and further restrict the wildlife trade nationwide. The measures are expected to be enshrined in the country’s wildlife protection law later this year. The ban is a swift response to the Covid-19 outbreak, thought to have originated in wildlife sold at a market in Wuhan, Hubei province in early December. However, the Shenzhen government’s potential ban on dog and cat meat is framed not as part of an effort to reduce disease transmission, but as an aspect of the special relationship between people and pets, which it has called the “consensus of all human civilisation”. “Shenzhen might just be able to do it, as it is a progressive city in many ways,” said Deborah Cao, a professor at Griffith University in Australia and expert on animal protection in China. “I really hope so.” Consumption of dog and cat meat is most common in Shenzhen’s home province of Guangdong, neighbouring Guangxi, and parts of north-east China, though it is not universally practised across the country and has become less acceptable over time. Taiwan outlawed the consumption of dog and cat meat in 2017.  “Dog eating has become increasingly controversial in China, with frequent violent clashes between dog thieves and angry dog owners,” said Wendy Higgins, director of international media at Humane Society International (HSI). “There is a growing and vocal Chinese opposition to the dog and cat meat trade, and young people in China are far more likely to think of dogs as companions than cuisine,” she said. The draft regulation is now in a public comment phase running until 5 March and no timeline has been given for the final determination. If the ban goes through, other animals identified as potentially carrying disease – such as turtles, snakes, some birds and insects – could be included on a list of prohibited animals for consumption in line with national rules that are expected in the coming months. Under the Shenzhen ban, fines for serving banned animals at restaurants would range from 20,000 to 200,000 yuan (£2,200–£22,000). HSI has estimated that between 10 and 20 million dogs are killed in China for their meat annually, while protection group Animals Asia puts the figure for cats at roughly 4 million a year. “The vast majority of dogs caught up in the trade in China are stolen pets and strays snatched from the streets,” Higgins said. “After being stolen or snatched, the animals are crammed in small cages in their hundreds, unable to move, and piled on the back of trucks, packed so tightly they can break limbs.” Animal protection groups have long been concerned with practices used in the dog meat trade, from rearing and theft to transport and slaughter.\n",

      "Text: If the natural world was trying to have its say on the Glasgow climate pact, the arrival of a plague of scorpions in Egypt as Cop26 came to an end was not a subtle message. Around the time a tearful Alok Sharma lowered the gavel on the summit, rare thunderstorms were sweeping through Aswan province along the south of the Nile, forcing thousands of the creatures to seek shelter in people’s homes. Scorpion stings left more than 500 people needing hospital treatment in the host nation for Cop27. Nobody died from the effects of the venom and, as is often the case, it is too early to say whether the climate crisis caused or intensified the flooding. But many experts warn we are at the beginning of a period of potentially biblical instability. “Cop26 was bad for nature because we are nowhere near limiting warming to 1.5 degrees,” said Simon Lewis, a professor of global change science at University College London who was supporting Congo basin countries in Glasgow. “Double the number of species will lose more than half of their climatically defined area at 2C than they would have at 1.5. So big changes are coming.” There were significant announcements on nature at Cop26 that could move the dial on global heating and biodiversity loss. Jair Bolsonaro, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin were among more than 100 world leaders to commit to halting and reversing deforestation and land degradation by the end of the decade, covering about 85% of the world’s forests. Meeting this target would avoid emissions equivalent to a quarter of global greenhouse gases from transport between 2009 and 2019, according to the World Resources Institute. Multibillion-dollar funding commitments were also made to protect vast carbon sinks such as the Congo basin. Four Latin American countries joined together to create an enormous marine reserve in the Pacific. Indigenous peoples were given $1.7bn (£1.26bn) in recognition of their role in protecting forests. But even during the summit, some of these paper commitments began to lose their gloss. Indonesia’s environment minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar said the deforestation pledge was “inappropriate and unfair” just days after it signed up. Others, many of whom have made deforestation commitments before, have not yet explained how they will monitor land-clearing reductions or what ending and reversing deforestation even means. Then there is the issue of trust. “Our commitments are real. We have – by far – one of the most ambitious NDCs [nationally determined contributions] in the world,” said Leonardo Cleaver de Athayde, Brazil’s lead climate negotiator, on his way home from Glasgow, when asked if the world could really believe the deforestation pledge made by Bolsonaro’s government. Deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest soared 22% in the past year to the highest level since 2006, according to the government’s annual figures, released this week. Campaigners have warned Brazil’s cattle ranching plan will drive further land-clearing via the back door. The link between nature and the climate was a clear theme in Glasgow and did make the final decision text, despite division over the wording. In June, a report from 50 of the world’s leading scientists warned humanity must solve the climate and nature crises together or solve neither, something which the UK presidency had clearly embraced. There were peatland-themed pavilions and dozens of events on nature conservation and the climate. But battles over the role of nature in carbon offsetting and so-called nature-based solutions were not resolved in Glasgow, and will continue at the UN’s biodiversity Cop in Kunming, China, next year. And despite frequent references to the importance of respecting the rights of indigenous peoples, many of those communities want to see action rather than words. Meanwhile, evidence of the intertwined fates of the Earth’s climate and the natural world continues to mount. In western Canada, the same areas that endured a summer heatwave of temperatures above 45C and wildfires are now experiencing heavy flooding. In the Andes, guanacos – close relatives of llamas – are heading to lower ground in search of better grazing because of the changing climate. Great white sharks are moving to new areas. So too are polar bears, leading to increased conflict with humans. But unless humans cut greenhouse gas emissions, experts are clear that these changes are just the beginning and present a major threat to the natural world. “We’re going to see changes in land use. Anywhere there’s biodiversity or wildlife in the way has a real potential for new conflicts that weren’t there before,” said Alexandra Zimmermann, a senior research fellow at the University of Oxford’s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit. “Climate events are sudden.

      "Text: The Labour party is planning to put the UK at the head of a worldwide green industrial revolution, with a massive US-style, public-private investment scheme targeted at the most deprived regions. In an interview with the Observer, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, who will travel to Washington in May to meet senior Democrats, says a Labour government will follow the model of US president Joe Biden’s hugely ambitious regional recovery plan, using the climate crisis as the catalyst for economic revival. She says Labour’s new national wealth fund, to be endowed with an initial £8bn of funding from the state but which it is hoped will then pull in private investment, will be given a specific remit to focus on green industrial revival in deprived areas with regional targets to create hundreds of thousands of jobs outside London and the south-east. Ahead of the spring budget on Wednesday, in which the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, will be under pressure to prevent an exodus of UK green industries to the US and the EU – both of which are preparing incentives to lure green firms from overseas – both Labour and the Tories are determined to ensure the UK will not be left behind. Hunt is set to announce a £20bn investment in technology to reduce Britain’s carbon emissions in the budget, as well as plans to boost the nuclear sector with a competition to develop small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). Many UK companies, Reeves said, were desperate to invest in areas such as offshore wind, tidal energy, green hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, but feared that without government backing – on a partnership model like that pioneered by Biden in his Inflation Reduction Act – they “would not get off the ground”. “The Tories are the last people in town believing that the ‘laissez faire’ approach of leaving it all to the market can work. Everyone else recognises that, in a world of such huge change and increased competition between nations for this investment, you have to have this partnership approach,” she said. “All of this is up for grabs, no-one is doing a lot of this stuff at scale yet. We could be global leaders in some of this. There is a real urgency because growth is so low. This would be real levelling up, where the government has failed. We have got a serious plan and we just want a chance to get on and get started with it.” Several key UK-based companies are now examining where best to operate. Jaguar Land Rover’s owner, Tata Motors, has reportedly asked the UK government for more than £500m in state subsidies to build a battery factory in Somerset, a move seen as crucial to the future of the entire British car industry. Reeves said: “The government said we were going to get electric vehicle production and batteries here but we haven’t and Jaguar Land Rover (Britain’s biggest car maker) are on the verge of making a really big decision. It is crucial that batteries are produced by JLR in Britain or, as night follows day, more car production will move overseas.” In January, the UK battery start-up Britishvolt collapsed into administration, with the majority of its 300 staff made redundant after talks about rescue bids failed. The company’s efforts to build a large facility near Blyth came unstuck as it struggled to find a cash injection to pursue the project. It has now been bought by an Australian company. Labour has already committed to investing £28bn a year – or £224bn over its first eight years in government – on climate measures. Reeves says it will aim to create 450,000 new jobs over a decade from green industrial projects – in which the UK public will have a stake – including 50,000 in the north-west and Yorkshire, and 30,000 in the north-east, the East Midlands, the West Midlands and the east of England. Reeves is planning to meet key architects of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) during her May visit and make a speech from there to “show the UK can deliver global leadership on climate change, on new industries and on the future of economic thinking”. Biden’s IRA was signed into law in August last year and aims to spur investment in green technology by devoting billions of dollars in subsidies through grants, loans and tax credits to public and private entities. It has a strong focus on electric vehicles and the battery industry. Since it was announced it has drawn investment into areas such as Michigan, a rust belt state, where Ford has revealed plans to build a $3.5bn electric vehicle battery plant that would create 2,500 jobs. The company explicitly referenced the Biden legislation as being a factor in its decision to locate there instead of Canada or Mexico. The EU is expected to unveil more details this week of its net-zero industry act, which is also designed to lead to a big acceleration of green technology in EU member states, with recent changes to state aid rules also in the pipeline. The Institute for Directors recently called for a UK version of the Inflation Reduction Act to “incentivise much-needed green investment” and prevent the UK being left behind. Reeves said: “The exciting thing about some of the new industries of the future, whether it is floating offshore wind, or carbon capture and storage, or green hydrogen, is that they are going to create good jobs in places outside London and the south-east, in former industrial areas, in coastal communities. We are taking inspiration from president Biden and the US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen.”\n",

      "Text: The failure by governments and businesses to accelerate energy efficiency efforts is “inexplicable”, according to the head of the International Energy Agency. Fatih Birol said saving more energy was “utterly essential” in cutting household’s rocketing bills, ending reliance on fossil fuel regimes such as Russia, and rapidly lowering the CO2 emissions driving the climate crisis. New analysis by the IEA showed that doubling the rate of energy efficiency improvements seen in the last decade would, by 2030, slash global energy use by the same amount used in China every year, saving households $650bn. It would also cut oil and gas use by far more than Russia exports to the EU. Ending these exports is a key EU goal after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The IEA said greater efficiency could be readily achieved with existing technologies and would pay back fully the investment through lower running costs, especially at today’s high energy prices. Important measures include the rollout of electric cars and heat pumps, more efficient household appliances such as fridges and TVs, and people nudging down home thermostats and choosing greener travel. In the UK, making homes warmer and cheaper to heat through better insulation is key. The UK government has committed £37bn to helping households with energy bills but has not announced any new efficiency measures, leading critics to accuse ministers of spending billions but still leaving people “at the mercy of global oil and gas prices”. Launching the IEA report, Birol said: “Energy efficiency is a critical solution to so many of the world’s most urgent challenges. But inexplicably, government and business leaders are failing to sufficiently act on this. “The oil shocks of the 1970s set in motion major advances in efficiency, and it is utterly essential that efficiency is at the heart of the response to today’s global energy crisis,” he said. Denmark is hosting an IEA summit on energy efficiency, attended by dozens of ministers from around the world. The country’s climate and energy minister, Dan Jørgensen, said: “It’s no longer a question of whether we should implement more energy efficient solutions globally – it’s a question of how we are going to do that. By increasing our energy efficiency, we can reduce our dependence on Russian oil and gas completely, and move closer to achieving climate neutrality.” The IEA report used energy intensity – the amount of energy used per dollar of GDP – as its measure of energy efficiency. Increasing the rate of improvement from 2% a year, seen from 2010 to 2020, to 4% would lead to a cut in energy use equivalent to 5bn tonnes a year of CO2 by 2030. This is the same amount emitted by the US today and a third of the global emissions cut needed to prevent the worst effects of the climate crisis. This global push for energy efficiency would also cut oil use by almost 30m barrels a day – about three times Russia’s production in 2021. It would also reduce gas use by four times the amount the EU imported from Russia in 2021, and help create 10m new jobs, the IEA said. Energy efficiency advances have already had a huge effect on global emissions, with improvements since 2000 resulting in 8bn tonnes of CO2 emissions a year being avoided. This is close to the annual output of China, the world’s biggest polluter. “The leaders meeting at the IEA [summit] needs to make this the moment when the world hits the accelerator on efficiency, or we may pay the price for years to come,” said Birol. Kim Fausing, CEO of engineering company Danfoss, said: “We don’t need to wait. We need action because the greenest energy is the energy we don’t use.” The UK government approved a new gas field in the North Sea last week and new tax breaks could see £8bn of additional projects, according to analysts. Michael Bradshaw, professor of global energy at Warwick Business School, said: “Investing in fossil fuel production is not compatible with the Paris Agreement. The ‘no regrets’ solution is a reduction in fossil fuel consumption through efficiency, demand reduction, and an increase in clean energy sources.” On Tuesday Tony Danker, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, called on the UK government to make “an all-out national effort” on energy efficiency, saying people must not be left “at the mercy of global oil and gas prices”. He said: “Do we want a new normal of energy efficiency or a new normal of billion-pound bailouts every quarter?” A new report from green thinktank E3G sets out an £8bn efficiency strategy to upgrade more than 3m homes by 2025, saving families between £450 and £1,000 a year. Senior policy adviser Juliet Phillips said: “The UK government must decide whether it wants to go on spending £37bn a year just to stand still, or to invest now in permanent solutions for lower bills.”\n",

      "Text: One of the problems of change is changing our old ways of thinking. This applies particularly to energy (Power struggle: fears for UK energy generation as green projects delayed, 16 February). The old way is to have large centralised companies supplying fuel and power that is cheap enough for us to use wastefully, yielding large profits for their shareholders. So inevitably this is how people tend to think of net zero. But this won’t work, as your article shows. The new way involves, first, using less. Insulating homes, reducing the need to travel, reviving local high streets, encouraging foot and cycle traffic, moving people and freight from road to rail, even considering what colour to paint flat roofs to reflect heat – all of this will remove demand from the energy market. Less profit but more gain. Byproducts include reviving the economy, cleaner air and water, cheaper bills and healthier people. Second, why should supply be centralised? Relax restrictions on solar panels for power and heat, and subsidise. Our aim should be to have as many buildings become as self-sufficient in energy as possible. Third, develop more localised generation. Combined heat and power for districts, for example, could fill much of the gap. The grid then becomes the backstop, to fill in the rest. There’s only one major problem – lower dividends for the CEOs and shareholders who donate to the Tory party.

      "Text: Fossil fuel industries in Australia could be left behind by improvements in renewables and the possibility Donald Trump changes tack on a carbon tax, a former US Republican congressman has warned. In a speech to the National Press Club on Wednesday, Bob Inglis, a conservative advocate for private sector action on climate change, called for the United States to take unilateral action by imposing a carbon tax with an import levy on goods made in countries without a carbon price. Inglis, a congressman for 12 years who lost Republican preselection over his advocacy of a carbon price, argued that conservatives could be persuaded to join a coalition to fight climate change by appeals to the free market or to faith. Inglis was surprisingly upbeat about the prospect of Trump taking action on climate change. He claimed Trump was “channeling the fears of a fearful people” when he dismissed climate change as a “Chinese hoax” but could not possibly believe that. “There is some chance that President Trump, may respond to his daughter Ivanka’s interest in climate change. “There is a chance he may listen to secretary of state Rex Tillerson who, as recently as October was advocating for the same revenue neutral carbon tax we are proposing at [eco-right website] republicEN.org.” He predicted reality would force Trump to shift, as gas prices increase, coal mining jobs do not return and new technologies will be needed to create jobs. Inglis favoured a “revenue-neutral, border-adjustable carbon tax”, a plan in which Americans would be compensated for a carbon price with payroll and company tax cuts and the US would levy an import tax on countries without a carbon price. Channeling what he called “Trumpocene” rhetoric, Inglis said the new president could boast of “the art of the deal” and beating China in the World Trade Organisation court if the US “taxed their plastic coming into our Walmarts at the border”. “We don’t need an international agreement ... The way I’d put it is America can make a bold commercial move and the rest of the world will follow because China wants access to the American market,” he said, predicting the whole world would follow suit. Inglis warned that such a move posed a policy risk to Australia, because coal would be in a “very difficult economic position”. He said that technology also posed a risk to fossil fuel industries because improvements in solar power efficiency, battery storage and wind becoming more manageable in the grid would all make renewables a better investment. Inglis said that allowing the free market to operate by removing subsidies on all types of energy and reflecting environmental damage through a carbon price would promote technologies that mitigate climate change. Measures like removing tax credits for renewables would win Tea Party support but wind and solar would still be able to compete if the biggest subsidy – “being able to belch and burn into the trash dump of the sky” – is removed. Inglis recounted how his son had convinced him to take environmental issues seriously and predicted that the Republican Party would be forced by demographics to adopt a climate policy that was less hostile to the science of global warming. “Young people want us to be relevant to their future and they want to know why [we have to] be so retro in the Grumpy Old Party rejecting science,” he said, predicting Republicans would prefer to cast themselves as the “Great Opportunity Party”. The “eco-right’” asks “can free enterprise solve climate change”, he said, rather than framing the issue by asking whether people believe in climate change or not. But faith is also a tool of persuasion because “there is a deep and rich opportunity there to talk about loving God and loving people and the stewardship of the earth”, he said. Inglis said that in the field of climate change there is no contradiction between religious faith and science and people trust scientists all the time, such as doctors warning them about their cholesterol. Inglis said parliamentarians had to risk their seats over issues like the environment or end their careers in the pitiable position of being able to say only: “I stood for nothing, I accomplished nothing, I just went along with the flow”.\n",

      "Text: Replacing 20% of the world’s beef consumption with microbial protein, such as Quorn, could halve the destruction of the planet’s forests over the next three decades, according to the latest analysis. The move would also halve emissions from the global food system, by reducing the razing of trees and the methane emissions from livestock. Previous studies have found meat alternatives have lower environmental footprints but this latest analysis is the first to assess what impact that could have in the world. Deforestation also devastates wildlife but is proving very difficult to stop. Experts say the best way is to cut demand for the products driving the destruction, such as replacing them with greener alternatives. Microbial protein is brewed in warm bioreactors, like beer, with the microbes fed sugar. The protein-rich product could taste and feel like meat, and be as nutritious, the researchers said. Today, 83% of farmland is used for livestock and their feed crops, but the meat and dairy produced accounts for only 18% of the calories consumed by humans. The production of ruminant meat – mostly beef, but also lamb and goat – has more than doubled since 1961, but a series of studies have shown meat-eating in rich nations must fall drastically to beat the climate crisis. “The food system is at the root of a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, with ruminant meat production being the single largest source,” said Dr Florian Humpenöder, a researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany who led the study. “The good news is that people do not need to be afraid they can eat only greens in the future. They can continue eating burgers and the like, it’s just that those burger patties will be produced in a different way.” The research focused on microbial meat as it had been produced at industrial scale for 20 years and was already available, said Dr Isabelle Weindl, also at PIK. “Even accounting for the sugar as feedstock, microbial protein requires much less agricultural land compared [with] ruminant meat.” Previous studies have shown the protein quality of microbial meat is equivalent to beef but it requires 90% less land and water and produces 80% less greenhouse gas emissions. The study, which was published in the journal Nature, used computer models that included middle-of-the-road projections of socioeconomic factors such as rising demand for beef, growing world population, increases in income and shifts in international trade. The 56% reduction in deforestation – 78m hectares (193m acres) – resulting from one-fifth of beef being replaced by microbial protein occurred in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. Significant deforestation still occurred in the modelling due to the production of other foods, such as palm oil and cocoa. The researchers found the substitution of microbial protein largely cancelled out projected rises in demand for beef, meaning new areas of pasture did not need to be cut into forests. Increasing the proportion of beef replaced to more than 20% resulted in diminishing returns because much of the deforestation had already been prevented, with a 50% replacement leading to an 82% cut in deforestation by 2050. Microbial protein can be produced from a range of microorganisms, including bacteria, but the main source on the market today is produced from fungi, with the market leader being Quorn. “The best meat alternative is to eat less,” said Humpenöder. “But [microbial protein products] can make it easier for people to switch away from meat.” The study did not analyse the effect of plant-based alternatives to meat, but these would also be expected to significantly cut environmental impacts. Meat cultured in bioreactors from animal cells is still in early stages of development and was not included in the study because of a lack of suitable data. Dr Tilly Collins at Imperial College London, who was not part of the study team, said: “While the predictions of these models depend strongly on our ability to deliver such protein substitution, there is no doubt that the efficiency of biotech-enabled alternatives offers huge future potential for more sustainable food provision. “Governments and food production business need to coordinate to develop appropriate standards [for microbial protein] and thus future public confidence. Our nuggets may never be the same again.” The bioreactors used to create microbial protein require heating, and using high-carbon sources of electricity would offset part of their benefit, but green electricity is expanding quickly as costs continue to fall. Humpenöder said: “Microbial protein should not be seen as a silver bullet, but rather as a building block in a large transformation of the whole food and agricultural system, combining it with reductions in food waste, incentives to eat healthier, and de-incentivising the sale of products with high environmental impacts.”\n",

      "Text: A diverse group of religious, education and renewable energy sector leaders have gathered in Canberra to pressure Scott Morrison to cut $7.7bn worth of subsidies for fossil fuels in the budget. The coalition, organised by climate change advocacy group 350 and WWF, says as the government seeks to tackle the deficit community pressure is building to cut fossil fuel subsidies and invest instead in areas including health and renewable energy. The $7.7bn of subsidies include $5.5bn of non-agricultural fuel tax credits, $1.24bn for concessional rates of fuel excise on aviation fuel and $650m of tax deductions for exploration and prospecting by the mining industry. Earlier in April a poll by Reachtel found that 48% of respondents thought fossil fuel subsidies were too high, compared with 25% who said they were about right and 8.5% who said they were too low. Ending the subsidies was the most popular option for budget repair (36% in favour), ahead of reducing negative gearing benefits, raising the GST, increasing capital gains tax and tightening superannuation tax concessions – options which all got less than 20%. A majority of the 2,644 respondents wanted the money saved spent on health (27.5%) and/or growing renewable energy (26.3%) instead. Last month almost 50 organisations urged the government to end fossil fuel subsidies. “The government is spending money through the emissions reduction fund to reduce emissions while also providing subsidies to pollute through the measures listed above,” they said. “This makes little environmental and economic sense.” The chief executive of the renewable energy company Roofjuice, Nigel Morris, said: “If you look up the definition of ‘innovation’ it doesn’t say ‘support a declining, obsolete industry with massive subsidies’. “It’s time the government started investing in the future, not the past. The fossil fuel sector is on the decline … The only thing slowing down this transition now is the billions in handouts to the fossil fuel sector.” A former Anglican bishop, George Browning, said: “Science and Christianity are on the same page in urging human responsibility in the face of escalating climate change.” He added: “The clock is ticking. We cannot sit on our hands any longer.” A Uniting church minister, Seforosa Carroll, who manages church partnerships in the Pacific region, said: “The mining and burning of fossil fuels is destroying our islands and our cultural heritage. We bear the brunt of the damaging effects of climate change to our ecosystems and livelihoods. “The continuing multibillion-dollar subsidies by the Australian government to fossil fuel companies will in the long term have a serious impact on the already vulnerable Pacific communities by further undermining their future.” An Australian Education Union ACT branch campaigns officer, Luke Stickels, said: “Continuing to fund polluters when we know the damage being done to the environment is unforgivable intergenerational theft. It is grossly foolish and unfair.” In comments on Friday welcoming Australia’s decision to sign the Paris climate agreement the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, said domestic legislation would fail to give practical effect to the agreement. “In Australia we have the Liberal, National and Labor parties that have, in the past year, cut our renewable energy target, approved huge new coalmines, supported fossil fuel subsidies, taken donations from fossil fuel companies, and set pollution-reduction targets well below what the science says is necessary,” he said. Separate Parliamentary Budget Office costings for the Australian Greens estimate fossil fuel subsidies cost the budget $6bn a year and more than $21bn could be saved over a four-year period if they were cut. That figure did not include boosting the fuel excise on aviation fuel but proposed cutting funding for carbon capture and storage. On 19 April the Greens senator Lee Rhiannon wrote to the leaders of the Liberals, Nationals and Labor asking them to refuse donations from fossil fuel companies. Rhiannon said the millions of dollars given by fossil fuel companies had “sapped the vitality and integrity of Australia’s response to climate change”.\n",

      "Text: A landmark directive with the potential to ban tar sands oil from Europe has been reprieved, the Guardian has learned. The EU’s most senior energy official confirmed that the fuel quality directive (FQD) to encourage greener road fuels will not be scrapped at the end of the decade, as had been thought. Around 15% of Europe’s carbon emissions come from road transport and ambitious plans for cutting emissions from vehicles are expected to form a significant chunk of the bloc’s ‘Energy Union’ proposals next week. Asked by the Guardian whether that meant the FQD would continue after 2020, the EU’s vice president for energy union, Maroš Šefčovič, said: “My first reaction is yes. We just have to adjust it to all the lessons learned from biofuels, and all the [other] lessons learned from the previous time.” The FQD has been a platform for measures intended to price tar sands out of the European market – and for targets to provide 10% of Europe’s transport fuel from low carbon sources, mostly biofuels, by 2020. Transport fuels are the only European sector in which emissions are still rising and the directive mandates a 6% reduction in their greenhouse gas intensity by 2020. But specific measures to bring this about in the FQD were strongly opposed by Canada, which threatened trade retaliation if the EU acted on scientific advice and taxed tar sands oil at a higher rate because they are more polluting than conventional oil. Environmentalists also complained that the 10% target for biofuels was driving deforestation and pushing up commodity prices. Last year, the commission appeared to wash its hands of the whole issue, saying that it did “not think it appropriate” to establish new greenhouse gas intensity targets for transport fuels after 2020. The news that this position seems to have changed under a new commission was applauded by Friends of the Earth Europe. “It’s vital the Commission tackles Europe’s transport emissions, which will be the largest source of emissions by 2030,” said Colin Roche, a campaigner for the group. “What’s absolutely crucial now is that any renewal of the fuel quality directive is a real deterrent to European imports of climate-killing tars sands and damaging crop-based biofuels,” he added. “Europe cannot afford to ignore this black hole in their climate strategy.” The Cooperative, which has an ethical investment policy, believes that a continuation of the FQD opens up new possibilities for investor action on tar sands. “It would be incredibly useful for responsible investors to be able to look at the carbon intensity of different oil companies’ products – to put pressure on them to reduce it, and speed the shift to a a low carbon economy,” said Colin Baines, the bank’s campaigns manager. A reprieve for the directive will also improve the chances of a positive vote on sustainability criteria for biofuels in the European Parliament, according to Jos Dings, the director of the Transport and Environment think tank. “This is an important and very significant announcement,” he told the Guardian. “If the commission is prepared to look again at the clean transport fuel issue, it can only be an encouragement to do the right thing in parliament next week.”\n",

      "Text: A controversial plan that would have placed one of Europe’s most important and threatened wetlands in even greater jeopardy has been paused after an unexpected agreement was reached between Spain’s caretaker government and the regional authorities in Andalucía. Water supplies to the Doñana national park in western Andalucía – whose marshes, forests and dunes extend across almost 130,000 hectares (320,000 acres) and include a Unesco-listed national park – have declined drastically over the past 30 years because of climate breakdown, farming, mining pollution and marsh drainage. Environmental groups have long campaigned to protect the area, which sustains millions of migrating birds and is home to a major population of endangered Iberian lynxes, pointing out that the illegal wells sunk to feed the region’s numerous soft fruit farms are stressing the aquifer. Despite such objections – and blunt warnings from Unesco and the European Commission – Andalucía’s conservative regional government announced plans last year to increase the amount of irrigable land around Doñana by 800 hectares, thereby introducing a de facto amnesty for the strawberry farmers who have sunk illegal wells there. On Tuesday evening, however, the regional president, Juan Manuel Moreno, said an imminent vote on the plans would be suspended after a meeting with Spain’s acting environment minister, Teresa Ribera, during which a €350m (£303m) package of measures for the region was discussed. Although details of the package have yet to be finalised, they are believed to include measures to further protect the area, diversify the local economy away from its reliance on soft fruit, and develop a regulatory scheme to guarantee the environmental credentials of the fruit grown in Andalucía’s Huelva province. Speaking after the meeting, Moreno hailed the talks with Ribera as “a first step that could lead to solutions for situations that are often complicated”. He added: “It’s also the right path to follow: when you have two administrations with different positions, you have the responsibility to do everything in your power to reach an agreement – that’s what our citizens ask of us.” Ribera, who had previously accused Moreno and his People’s party of using the proposed amnesty as a means of pandering to the far-right Vox party in the run-up to May’s local elections, said she was confident the preliminary agreement would benefit everyone. “I think this was important – obviously for the people of Huelva and for Doñana – but also for Andalucía and for Spain,” she told the state broadcaster TVE on Wednesday morning. “Because of the international dimensions of the situation, the world was looking at what was going on in Doñana. I think this will allow us to save Doñana while also bringing territorial and social development. It will yield a future and progress by bringing greater diversification of economic activity without putting Doñana at risk.” Environmental groups welcomed the deal but warned much more was still needed to be done to safeguard Doñana. “We’re celebrating the withdrawal of the anti-Doñana law,” said Juan Carlos del Olmo, the secretary general of WWF Spain. “It’s time to work to bring about development that obeys the law and which, above all, allows for the recovery of Doñana. There’s a lot of work to do but this is a step in the right direction.” Luis Berraquero, Greenpeace’s Andalucía coordinator, said that while the plan was a positive step, “we need to listen to all the voices – to the science, to the EU, to the environmental groups and to the hydrological plans – and we need to ensure that there is an end to the theft of water and to illegal irrigation in the area”. The plan, he added, needed to guarantee a “fair water transition that takes into account not only the families who are affected but also guarantees the provision of water necessary for the park’s survival”. A report earlier this year from Spain’s national research council noted that 59% of Doñana’s large lakes had not been full since at least 2013, and that the area was in a “critical condition”. For the past two summers, Doñana’s largest permanent lake dried up completely. The proposed increase in irrigable land had also drawn criticism from a group of leading UK supermarkets, including Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose, Lidl, Aldi and Morrisons. Last year, the chains wrote to Moreno, warning him that the move risked damaging “the reputation and the long-term development of the region”.\n",

      "Text: Combining solar power and microbes could produce 10 times more protein than crops such as soya beans, according to a new study. The system would also have very little impact on the environment, the researchers said, in stark contrast to livestock farming which results in huge amounts of climate-heating gases as well as water pollution. The concept uses electricity from solar panels and carbon dioxide from the air to create fuel for microbes, which are grown in bioreactor vats and then processed into dry protein powders. The process makes highly efficient use of land, water and fertiliser and could be deployed anywhere, not just in countries with strong sunshine or fertile soils, the scientists said. Food security is a “critical issue” for humanity in coming decades, they said, with the global population growing, biofuels competing for land with crops, and about 800 million people already undernourished today. Furthermore, tackling the climate crisis will be near impossible without slashing emissions from animal and dairy food production. Microbes are already used to make many common foods, such as bread, yoghurt, beer and Quorn. But other researchers said converting consumers to eating microbial protein might be difficult and that such foods may not be nutritionally complete. Dorian Leger, at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology in Potsdam, Germany, who led the new analysis, said: “We think microbial foods are very promising and will be one of the major contributors to solving the potential food crisis. “It might pick up quite quickly on the consumer side, but it’s hard to say. “But I do some exercise, and if I was offered a bacterial protein shake now, I would have it.” The team focused on soya beans, as these are linked to the destruction of forests and are mostly fed to animals, but other bacteria produce the main elements of palm oil. “Bacteria are very flexible, so they could eventually be tuned to different products,” Leger said. At least a dozen companies are already producing animal feed from microbes but the bacteria are typically fed either sugars from other crops or methane or methanol from fossil fuels. Solar Foods, based in Finland, is using electricity to create food for humans. The new assessment, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, is the first quantitative comparison of land use and energy efficiency between traditional agriculture and solar-powered microbial production systems. The researchers used data on today’s technologies to calculate the efficiency of each step of the process, including capturing CO2 from the air and processing the microbes into food that people could eat. They found the microbial system used just 1% of the water needed by the crops and a small fraction of the fertiliser, most of which is wasted when used in fields. The analysis estimated that the solar-microbial process could produce 15 tonnes of protein from each hectare (or per 2.5 acres) a year, enough to feed 520 people, which the scientists said was a conservative estimate. In comparison, a hectare of soya beans could produce 1.1 tonnes of protein, feeding 40 people. Even in countries with relatively low sunlight levels like the UK, microbial protein production was at least five times greater from each hectare than plants. The microbial protein would cost about the same as current proteins eaten by people, such as whey or pea, the researchers suggested. But it was several times more expensive than current animal feeds, although future technological improvements are expected to lower costs. Leger said plants’ ability to photosynthesise is remarkable but, in terms of energy efficiency, staple crops only convert about 1% of solar energy into edible biomass. This is because plants have evolved to compete and reproduce as well as just grow, and use less of the solar light spectrum than photovoltaic panels. All the components of the system exist, but Leger said they now need to be tested together and at scale, in particular the capturing of CO2 from the air and ensuring that used solar panels can be recycled. “For human food, there’s also a lot of regulation that needs to be overcome,” he said. Pete Iannetta, at the James Hutton Institute in Scotland, said: ““It’s a really interesting concept – you are divorcing food production from land use, which would mean you could have all that land available for rewilding.” But he said food is not only composed of the main nutrients, like protein and carbohydrate: “There are an awful lot of secondary compounds that are important for your wellbeing.” Iannetta also questioned whether microbial foods would become mainstream: “For example, we have used algae for a long time as a potential food resource, but it’s still not widely accepted.” Dr Toby Mottram, a consultant on agricultural technology, said: “Until the model is tested and costed with a pilot-scale plant, including a lifecycle assessment of [solar panel] production, it is hard to comment on whether it improves on [farming] systems which have been sustained for thousands of years, albeit for a lower population than we are planning to feed.”\n",

      "Text: Michael McCarthy is quite wrong when he says most people are unaware of the destruction of Britain’s wildlife (We’ve lost half our wildlife. But the damage can be reversed, 26 March). Even if you never visit the countryside, if you have any kind of garden you will be painfully aware of it. Twenty years ago my bird feeder nearly always had numerous birds on it (eight at a time was the record, I seem to remember). Now the peanuts wither and go black in the feeder. Then, we had many species; now, one pair of blackbirds, one pair of robins and a couple of greedy pigeons. Twenty years ago I saw a mother hedgehog parading through the garden trailing several babies. Now, I haven’t seen a hedgehog for at least a decade. Up until a couple of years ago the frogs in my garden pond had their riotous mating ceremony around St Valentine’s Day, followed quickly by masses of spawn and then by innumerable tadpoles. Now the date has become variable but results in very little spawn, which after a couple of weeks collapses into featureless slime. The number of pond species has steeply declined and if you put (say) daphnia into a jar of pondwater, they all die instantly. The problem is, what do I do about it apart from writing letters to the Guardian? The government is quite obviously either totally uninterested or completely in the grip of the big chemical firms and the farming lobby. I am delighted to be told that the problem is reversible, and I’m sure it is, but not without a political revolution, of which I see absolutely no sign.Jeremy CushingExeter  Farmers and land managers are stewards of the landscape, being responsible for the management of three-quarters of the land in the UK. This role comes with responsibilities towards wildlife, the environment and ecosystem services, which should be recognised and supported. As with any business, adjustments to benefit the environment will be more readily made if these are financially supported, and if the driving force behind the change comes from the farmers themselves the likelihood of success is increased. It is vital that funding that currently supports agriculture and the environment is retained and that policy delivers for Britain’s wildlife. Much can be done to improve this. We hope for an environmental policy that encourages conservation and environment measures across a larger scale and offers farmers greater choice and results in better outcomes for conservation. It is by working with our farmers, rather than against them, that we can offer a better future for Britain’s wildlife.Alastair LeakeDirector of policy, Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust (GWCT)   Michael McCarthy is correct in stating “the damage can be reversed” by switching the existing £3.1bn UK farm subsidy received from Brussels over to payments from Westminster to farmers for delivering public benefits such as restoring wildlife in the countryside. He says we will do this only if we can persuade the Treasury by way of “political pressure on the government”. This political pressure will occur only if the voting and taxpaying public, who predominantly live in towns and cities, are convinced it’s a good use of their cash. If this is to be achieved, the countryside closest to where most people live – the urban fringe – needs to be made both more accessible and more attractive. The farming community needs to realise the urban fringe is their “shop window”, the interface between them and their funders. The “best” countryside cannot go on being miles away from where most people live. Rather, it needs to be within 30 minutes by public transport, with a rich diversity of wildlife, footpaths and cycle ways, farmland with crops and animals, trees, forests, agro-forestry, allotments, cafes, open space, beautiful views, fresh air, peace and quiet… the exciting list goes on. And if it isn’t then there will be no political pressure from the voters to stop the Treasury clawing back the money back for the NHS, schools and housing.Paul Brannen MEPLabour, North East of England  Michael McCarthy is absolutely right to underline how little attention has been paid to the catastrophic loss of insect populations and farmland birds over the past 50 years, but this is part of a general trend that is accelerating. The three main factors driving species loss are climate change, loss of habitat, and the introduction of alien species into vulnerable populations. The rate of loss for all species is currently 1,000 times higher than normal, with half of all amphibians, a third of all corals, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all plant species and a sixth of birds under threat of extinction. Of course Homo sapiens is just another species that will disappear along with all the rest. If we lack the intelligence or the motivation to stop this process, we probably don’t deserve the description of sapiens.Dr Robin Russell-JonesChair, Help Rescue The Planet   Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com  Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters\n",

      "Text: Governments will need to move faster and find more money to meet “ambitious” targets of cutting pollution in Great Barrier Reef waters, a Queensland government taskforce has found. An interim report released on Monday by a water science taskforce called for more urgency – and the injection of corporate and philanthropic funding – to improve reef water quality as a bulwark against its greatest long-term threat, climate change. The taskforce, led by Queensland’s chief scientist, Dr Geoff Garrett, found the investment needed to cut nitrogen runoff by 80% and total sediment runoff by 50% in reef waters was likely to go “well beyond funds allocated by both [federal and state] governments”. The report found current investment in monitoring, modelling and reporting was “not enough to adequately measure” water quality across the 2,300km long reef. This handicapped a “vital” element of the reef’s 2050 conservation plan, which helped Australia avoid an embarrassing “in danger” listing of the natural wonder by Unesco in June. The state auditor general in June released a report casting doubt on claims of progress in water quality because of “significant uncertainty” around modelling amid a lack of monitoring sites. The taskforce recommended better “leverage” of government funding to attract “corporate and philanthropic funds through public private partnerships”. Queensland is spending an extra $90m over the next four years on top of its $35m a year on reef water quality, while the commonwealth has set up a $140m reef trust. The taskforce said regulation was needed around “pollution load limits” and urban and industrial developments in reef catchments should be restricted to “ensure no net increase in water pollution”. It called for more financial incentives for landholders to cut runoff, including loans, tax breaks for farm amalgamations and “voluntary retirement of marginal land from production”. Garrett said there was “no one silver bullet” for meeting the pollution targets. “Despite significant investment and goodwill from the government and all partners, accelerated uptake of improved land management practices is needed,” he said. “We need to take stronger action and we need to do it now. “A healthy reef that is resilient to the future impacts of climate change needs clean water. To have clean water, we need to greatly reduce the amount of fertiliser, sediment and chemicals coming from all sources – farms, urban development and industry.” The Queensland minister for the environment and the Great Barrier Reef, Steven Miles, said he was “delighted” to accept the report, which was an “important milestone” in developing the state government’s investment priorities and meeting “our ambitious water quality targets”. “Last week I was in Paris as part of the United Nations COP21 climate summit where we saw clearly that the world is finally accepting that the need for action is now urgent,” Miles said. Queensland Greens senator Larissa Waters has criticised premier Annastacia Palaszczuk for saying the state would “always be reliant on coal”. Palaszczuk told the ABC that while her government would “look at” lifting its renewable energy target through its focus on wind and solar farms, “coal is a backbone of our economy”. Waters said this was “ludicrous”. “Try telling that to the thousands of workers who have been sacked by the coal industry recently without a transition plan being provided by the big parties,” she said. Waters accused Palaszczuk of a “go-slow” on the state renewable energy target of 50% by 2030, saying the government had “gone quiet” since promising action during its election campaign and putting off any announcements until next year. “The Labor government is proving just as bad as Campbell Newman’s when it comes to pushing ahead with new coalmines and they’re failing to keep their promises to support renewable energy,” Waters said.  “The coal industry is in structural decline and we need a transition plan to provide jobs in 21st century industries, like clean energy, which doesn’t ruin tourism and agriculture jobs as the coal industry does.”\n",

I mean genuine plants to process plastic from the UK and the rest of Europe, not just depots for onward reselling as seems to have been the case.  There are initiatives to use such waste plastic in innovative ways. For example there is a small startup company in Scotland, MacRebur, developing ways to reduce the amount of toxic bitumen in asphalt by substituting a proportion of waste plastic into the mix. Surely we should urge government and private industry to build and develop plants to deal with the problem now, before we are knee-deep in bottles?Ian PaulYork  China’s huge expansion of domestic renewables and $8bn in solar technology exports last year alone is stunning (China on track to lead in renewables as US retreats, report says, theguardian.com, 10 January). I wish we had the same level of vision and drive in the UK government and parliament to follow a similar model. While there has been welcome expansion in offshore wind, solar and onshore wind are stalling as the impact of deep subsidy cuts bite. The vacillation over tidal energy is evidence of another renewable revolution being spurned, allowing our competitors to steal a march on us. This compares markedly with an attitude of bending over backwards to assist overseas operators with billions of pounds in effective subsidy support for new nuclear projects. It is an illogical and irrational energy policy which could drive energy bills up rather than down. Last year was a record one for renewable energy in the UK, with solar and wind combined producing more electricity generation than coal for 315 days of the year, but will it continue as these negative policies begin to bite?   With the urgent need to decarbonise heat, and transport offering other benefits to the economy, let’s see some Chinese-type ambition in all sectors of our low-carbon renewable energy industry to drive an alternative energy revolution.Feargal DaltonConvener, Nuclear Free Local Authorities Secretariat Scotland  We are currently in Veganuary, where people are encouraged to abandon their carnivorous ways and eat a vegan diet for the month of January.

      "Text: Contrary to the article by James Hansen, Kerry Emanuel, Ken Caldeira and Tom Wigley (Nuclear power paves the only viable path forward on climate change, 3 December), many scientists around the world remain sceptical that nuclear is the answer, or even part of the answer, to climate change. The academic authors have a fine record in identifying the causes and consequences of climate change, but their proposed solution simply doesn’t make sense. The main problem is that, contrary what many think, nuclear power is a poor method of reducing carbon emissions: its uranium ore and fuel processes have heavy carbon footprints. Indeed, of the ways to reduce carbon emissions in the energy sphere, nuclear is by far the most expensive in terms of pound per tonne of carbon saved. Renewables, especially wind and solar, are now less expensive, quicker to install, and much safer: with them one does not have to worry about the spectres of Chernobyl and Fukushima. But perhaps most important of all is the moral dimension. Given the technical and political obstacles to dangerous spent nuclear fuel, should we be passing these problems to future generations? What about the Irish Sea, still the most radioactively contaminated sea in the world due to Sellafield’s discharges? What about the sheep farms in north Wales still subject to food controls due to radioactive contamination from Chernobyl almost 30 years ago? The climate change negotiators in Paris should think hard before recommending nuclear as a solution. It isn’t.Dr Paul Dorfman Dr Ian Fairlie Dr David Lowry Jonathon Porritt   In his speech to COP in Paris, Prince Charles said “We must save our forests” and “There is no plan B to tackle climate change without them.” I agree our forests are vital; but there is a plan B that would save them – and mitigate climate change. It would also greatly reduce hunger, malnutrition and poverty. To save tropical forests we first have to reduce the pressures from tropical agriculture. This involves simple and inexpensive biological approaches to rehabilitate degraded farm land and improve crop yields from the current 10-15% of their biological potential. Then we need to plant local, highly favoured, traditionally important food trees to reduce hunger and malnutrition – species like safou, marula, shea, eru, baobab, and hundreds of others producing tasty, nutritious and marketable fruits, nuts and edible leaves. This diversification also restores ecological health and, importantly, generates income from the sale of their products in local markets. The final step is to set up new cottage industries to process and add value to these products, creating business and job opportunities to further improve household livelihoods. Of course, this is the antithesis of conventional modern agriculture and is not understood by policymakers, but where it has been done it has been a huge success – see “Living with the Trees of Life – Towards the Transformation of Tropical Agriculture” (CABI, 2012). If you don’t believe me, ask the poor farmers of Africa. They fully understand it, and make the importance of this abundantly clear when they apply to us at the International Tree Foundation for funding. Prof Roger LeakeyInternational Tree Foundation  News about the airstrikes in Syria is in danger of overshadowing developments at the climate conference in Paris. Some environmentalists may view this as regrettable, but the upside is that it should serve to highlight that the two are actually linked. Between 2006 and 2009 Syria experienced its worst recorded drought. It left up to 1.5 million people refugees in their own country. This placed severe demands on urban centres to employ, house and feed rising populations that were largely ignored by the Assad government. Protests and the subsequent uprising in 2011 led to the current civil war and the rise of Daesh. A study by Kelley et al published this year in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (doi: 10.1073/pnas.1421533112) makes a convincing case for the initial drought to be associated with human-modified climate change. Increasing conflict, mass migration and geopolitical instability are the real impacts of unmitigated climate change.Prof John DearingUniversity of Southampton  I sat in my house in Kendal on Saturday night watching the floodwaters creep up the road to a level never seen before. I was terrified, as were friends and townspeople. My neighbours had to evacuate, their homes waist-deep in water. The floodwaters stopped one house away from mine. Storms hitting north-west England, particularly Cumbria, are becoming more common. They cause terror and disruption to us and our infrastructure on a scale that terrorists could never hope to achieve. Why is the government not waging war on climate change? The implication of climate-induced disruption and terror for people in their everyday lives is huge. Surely we should be dealing with this threat as a priority and making our infrastructure more resilient to such weather extremes. Cumbria county council is facing another round of enormous cuts. How are we supposed to get back on our feet after these catastrophic floods when there is no money to fix the roads and railways, to fix flooded schools and day centres, and pay staff to do so? There is of course money to bomb Syria, despite the fact that severe climate change-induced weather events are significantly more of a threat to our way of life than Daesh.Dr Kate WillshawKendal, Cumbria  Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n",

      "Text: Europe’s largest pork producer misled customers with its “climate-controlled pork” campaign, Denmark’s high court has ruled in the country’s first climate lawsuit. Campaigners argued that Danish Crown greenwashed its meat with round, pink stickers on its packaging that said pigs were “climate-controlled”, along with a marketing campaign that claimed its pork was “more climate-friendly than you think”. The court ruled that the first claim violated Denmark’s marketing act, noting the labels came from Danish Crown itself rather than an independent body, but found the second claim was backed up well enough to use. “Today’s verdict sends a resounding message, not only within Denmark but throughout Europe, that misleading marketing tactics cannot hide behind the shield of freedom of speech,” said Rune-Christoffer Dragsdahl, the general secretary of the Vegetarian Society of Denmark, one of the plaintiffs. “Profiting from climate promises must be backed with legitimate climate action.” Denmark is Europe’s pork capital. It kills tens of millions of pigs each year in its slaughterhouses and exports most of the meat to other countries in the EU, according to the Danish Agriculture and Food Council. The court found that Danish Crown’s “climate-controlled pork” label had not been subject to independent control and so limited the average consumer’s ability to make an informed decision. The labelling could “significantly distort” the economic behaviour of the average consumer, it said. Danish Crown stopped using the label in 2021. But the court rejected arguments against the claim in Danish Crown’s marketing that its pork was “more climate-friendly than you think”. It said the statement was relative and cited a report showing that Danish consumers struggle to identify how polluting pork is – with most of them ranking pigs alongside cows. Pork emits less planet-heating emissions than beef per serving, but more than chicken. All three emit far more greenhouse gases than plant-based foods. “It’s more likely that pigs can fly than pork production can be climate friendly,” said Frederik Roland Sandby from the Climate Movement, an association of grassroot climate groups in Denmark. The case, brought by the Vegetarian Society of Denmark and the Climate Movement, is the first time greenwashing has been taken to trial in Denmark. Activists hope it can force wider shifts in the food industry as companies face greater scrutiny from advertising watchdogs and more pressure from courts. On Thursday the state of New York filed a suit against the US arm of JBS, the world’s largest meatpacker, accusing it of misleading customers over its climate goals. The court ordered Danish Crown to pay some of the legal costs, with a value of about €40,000 (£35,000). The company did not respond to requests for comment. “Today’s victory is David v Goliath in action, acting as a timely reminder to meat giants: no entity is above accountability,” said Sandby. “We hope this brings about a domino effect.”\n",

      "Text: Planes and trucks powered by hydrogen will be a crucial part of efforts to cut carbon emissions to safe levels, according to oil giant Shell. For the first time, the Anglo Dutch firm, which is facing calls by activist shareholders to take stronger action on global warming, has mapped out how the world could hit the Paris climate deal’s target of keeping temperature rises below 2C. While development of hydrogen cars has stalled in the face of rapid growth in battery-electric vehicles, Shell believes the gas could account for 10% of global energy consumption by the end of the century. The company’s Sky scenario, published on Monday, envisages that as fossil fuel use declines, old oil and gas facilities will be repurposed for hydrogen storage and transport. Shell has no large scale hydrogen production but is a major player in natural gas, from which hydrogen can be made. The company launched its first hydrogen refuelling point in the UK last year and on Tuesday will open a second at a service station in Buckinghamshire. The scenario envisages the first intercontinental hydrogen flight in 2040. By 2070, the majority of trucks will be powered by hydrogen or batteries, as Tesla is planning. Shell sees oil demand stagnating in the 2020s, followed by gas demand falling rapidly from 2040 as competition from renewables bites. Many power grids will be forced by legislation to become entirely run off solar, wind and hydro power by 2040. But the biggest impact from governments will come from carbon taxes or prices put in place by 2030 across rich countries and China. Industry watchers noted that the Sky scenario would still see temperatures rise to around 1.7-1.8C, above the Paris accord’s goal of pursuing efforts to limit rises to 1.5C, in addition to “well below” 2C.\n",

      "Text: Every morning a trio of churra lebrijana sheep turn up eagerly for work, toiling away as children head to school and the rush-hour traffic grips the southern Spanish city of Seville. Shaggy, skittish and nearly extinct, the daily outing is an unconventional attempt to help save the rare breed – by putting them to work. Since the start of this year, these churra lebrijana sheep – a breed indigenous to Andalusia whose numbers had dwindled to about two dozen animals – have spent hours each day grazing and getting to know the visitors to San Jerónimo park. The project is the culmination of a decades-long conservation effort by local officials and a bit of left-field thinking by ecologists. “They’re two things that are well-suited to each other,” says Juan Cuesta of Ecologists in Action in Seville. “The sheep cut the grass, fertilising as they go, reducing the need for noisy and polluting machines, while we promote the recovery of this breed.” The hardy sheep had long carved out an existence on the marshy lowlands of the Guadalquivir river, adapting to a landscape that swings from months of flooding to prolonged drought. As humans expanded their footprint, however, the marshes shrank from 150,000 hectares (370,000 acres) to less than 30,000 and the sheep were pushed out. While other breeds found favour with farmers, few were interested in the churra lebrijana. “Sheep are exploited for three products: meat, wool, milk,” says Antonio Siles, a retired vet who has worked in the province of Sevilla for many years. “This breed produces only enough milk to feed her offspring, the wool is of poor quality and its meat isn’t particularly good because it was never bred for that.” The breed’s coarse wool once was used to stuff mattresses. But when this practice began to decline about three decades ago, the number of churra lebrijana, also known as churra marismeña, plummeted. “It had practically disappeared,” says Siles. “I thought it would be such a pity to lose this breed. For me it’s just as important as the Iberian lynx or any other species.” He began contacting farmers to see if anyone still had churra lebrijana sheep, and found about 20 animals. “We bought them all,” he says, and took them to a farm owned by the province in the Sierra Norte national park. The intervention worked, and today there are about 400 of the sheep in Andalusia. “They are still in danger of extinction because there are very few of them, but we’re much better off than 20 years ago,” says Siles. About eight years ago, amid concerns that having all of the sheep in one flock left them vulnerable to being wiped out by illness, Siles began to look for farmers willing to take a few of the animals. “It had to be people who had a soft spot for the breed, because economically speaking there is no profit to be made.” Among those who expressed an interest was the Seville branch of Ecologists in Action. Six sheep were brought to the urban farm in San Jerónimo park that serves as the group’s headquarters, mingling with the resident chickens and goats. But hopes of putting the sheep out to pasture in the park were dashed. “The breed is incredibly surly, it’s unfriendly,” says Cuesta. The sheep wouldn’t let any humans near them, instead darting away when anyone approached. An unexpected break came last year when they realised that a handful of lambs that had needed to be bottle-fed had lost their fear of humans. “The character was completely different, more like a little dog that was fine with humans,” says Cuesta. For the past eight months, the San Jerónimo park sheep have been brought out to nibble the grass seven days a week. “When I arrive, they’re at the door, bleating and waiting for me to take them out,” says Pepe Serrano, the volunteer in charge of taking the animals out to pasture. The sheep’s shifts are punctuated with plenty of socialising with curious visitors and children eager to pet the woolly animals. Serrano uses these opportunities to share the story of the breed and the efforts to save it from extinction. “Most people tell me that they had no idea,” he says. So far there has been one major issue: dogs. “They’re curious, they’re sociable and the sheep are a novelty. So they approach,” says Serrano. “The sheep are terrified, they dash away – sometimes you find them on the other side of the park.” To keep the sheep under control as they graze, they are now secured to trees with a long piece of rope. The little flock has a constant companion, Pepa, the goat that they insist accompanies them everywhere. “They think the goat is their sister,” says Serrano. “If one goes out, they all have to go out. Otherwise they put on a whole show, bleating and running around. Until the four of them are together, they don’t calm down.” Currently, the project is limited to San Jerónimo park due to a lack of resources and the question of whether the next generation of churra lebrijana will inherit their parents’ easygoing attitude towards humans. In the meantime, there’s little doubt at Ecologists in Action that the daily outings are helping to save the breed. “They’re eating greens while people get to know them,” says Serrano. “It’s a way to make people aware that there is a breed that needs to be protected.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features\n",

      "Text: Just a few months ago, the idea that a new coal power station would ever be built in Australia seemed laughable. Banks, energy companies and even the Turnbull government seemed to accept the inevitable decline of the coal industry. But, since then, the Turnbull government has been furiously talking up the idea of “clean” coal. And while no bank is likely to finance the building of a new coal-fired power station here, Turnbull and his ministers have been indicating the government might themselves fund them. There’s been a lot of spin in this debate, so here are some facts. The term “clean coal” has recently been repurposed by the Turnbull government. Traditionally, it was a marketing term used by the coal industry to refer to coal power stations where the CO2 emissions would be captured and stored. But, in recent months, Turnbull and his ministers have been using the term “clean coal” to refer to what are called “ultra supercritical” coal power plants. These plants run at a higher temperature than ordinary coal power stations and reduce emissions by about 25%. But that is 25% lower than some of the dirtiest power plants around. Ultra supercritical power plants still produce about 740kg of CO2 per MWh – that’s compared with 400kg from efficient gas plants and the zero grams from wind and solar. The International Energy Agency – hardly a green group – has said OECD nations need to reduce emissions to 15kg per MWh in order to keep global temperature rises below 2C. Turnbull ministers have indicated they might use the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to finance new coal power stations. “It’s called the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, not the ‘Renewable Energy Finance Corporation’ – that’s an important distinction,” said the energy and environment minister, Josh Frydenberg, on ABC Radio National on Thursday. It does seem possible the government could use the CEFC to fund coal but it requires some serious contortions. The existing CEFC legislation explicitly rules out the funding of carbon capture and storage technology. So without changing the legislation, they would be only be able to fund plants that don’t use that technology. But the CEFC could only finance a coal power station if it determined it was a “low emissions technology”. However, the act does not directly define what a low emissions technology is. Instead, the board must make guidelines that define the term. The current guidelines interpret “clean energy technology” as one that produces 50% fewer emissions than the rest of the electricity grid. That seems reasonable and would rule out the funding of any coal power plant. In 2015 the national electricity market produced 0.81 tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent for each megawatt hour of electricity. Now, the most advanced coal power stations in the world currently emit about 740kg of carbon dioxide for each megawatt hour of electricity. That’s less than a 10% improvement over the existing electricity grid. (Advanced versions of the plants, which don’t currently exist, could potentially reach 640kg per MWh, which even then is only a 20% improvement over the existing grid.) No coal power station will fit within the current definition of “clean energy technology”. Frydenberg could write a new investment mandate, telling the CEFC that coal technology should be financed. That would probably force the CEFC to change their definition of “clean energy technology” to be consistent with ultra supercritical coal. So, in effect, the government would need to force the CEFC to change the definition of “clean energy” from one that is 50% better than the existing tech to one that is just 10% or 20% better. And that’s just compared to Australia’s relatively dirty grid. The most efficient coal power stations are significantly more polluting than the average of electricity generator in other OECD countries, which the International Energy Agency said was 420kg per MWh in 2014. All that aside, the CEFC would still need to decide that investing in a new coal power plants was a good commercial decision, since they need to make money on their loan. They would also need to find an energy company to build the plant. But, with most energy companies saying coal is a bad bet, it’s hard to see how that could happen. Tim Buckley from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said the CEFC would likely see the loan as a bad bet. “The stranded asset risks of investing in new coal-fired power plants are clear to almost all,” Buckley said. “At some point a carbon tax or ETS is inevitable and would need to be priced in.” Buckley said if that happened, the CEFC could well be stranded with any loan it’s given to coal power stations. Turnbull said in his National Press Club speech on Wednesday that “it’s security and cost that matter most, not how you deliver it”. But new coal technology is not cheaper than renewable energy. The US Energy Information Agency recently compared the cost of energy from various types of coal power plants and renewable energy plants. They found that ultra supercritical coal power plants were about twice as expensive to build per unit of energy, compared to wind farms, and almost 40% more expensive than solar farms. Then coal power stations have higher ongoing maintenance costs, as well as significant fuel costs, compared with the wind and solar where the fuel is free. Dylan McConnell from the Melbourne Energy Institute at the University of Melbourne said if those costs were recovered through energy prices, that would push energy prices up. Tennant Reed from the Australian Industry Group recently pointed out that wholesale electricity prices that are currently worrying big energy consumers have been sitting at about $75 per MWh. But recent projections by the CSIRO suggest the ultra supercritical coal generators would produce electricity at a cost of about $80 per MWh. “To build a coal plant with such costs, investors would need to expect wholesale prices to rise even above looming levels and stay there for decades,” Reed wrote. Reed also pointed out that the $80 per MWh projection was optimistic, since it was assuming that the power plants were being used at about 80% of their capacity, which was much higher than was generally the case. Meanwhile, new wind and solar will produce electricity at about $75-85/MWh today and that price will decrease in coming years. Buckley says: “So renewables are already at grid parity or cheaper than new USC coal-fired power, they can be built more modularly and five times faster, they have 100% emissions reduction relative to the PR spin called ‘clean coal’, they conform to our Paris CO2 commitments and they are likely to get finance – unlike a new coal-fired power plant.”\n",

      "Text: The government has launched an \"urgent\" review of the crisis facing bees and other pollinators in the UK and pledged to introduce a national pollinator strategy. \"As we all recognise, pollinators play a vital role in the security of our food supply and the quality of our natural environment,\" said Lord Rupert de Mauley, minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). \"In safeguarding their future, we can secure our own.\" Friends of the Earth's executive director Andy Atkins said: \"We're delighted that enormous pressure for a bee action plan from scientists, businesses and the public has stung the government into action. The minister's plan of action must be in place when bees emerge from hibernation next spring: we can't afford to gamble any longer with our food, countryside and economy.\" Bees and other pollinators fertilise three-quarters of global food crops and have seen severe declines in recent decades, due to loss of habitat, disease and harmful pesticides. In the UK, wild honey bees are nearly extinct, solitary bees are declining in more than half the areas studied and some species of bumblebee have been lost altogether. Poor weather last winter led to the death of a third of all honeybee colonies in England. In April, the European Union suspended the use of three neonicotinoid pesticides linked to serious harm in bees, despite the opposition of the UK ministers. De Mauley said: \"We know there are gaps in the evidence. That is why I am launching an urgent and comprehensive review of current policy, evidence and civil society action on pollinators to identify what needs to be done to integrate and step up our approach. This urgent review will form the basis of a national pollinator strategy, which will bring together all the pollinator-friendly initiatives already underway and provide an umbrella for new action.\" An independent group of experts convened by Defra's chief scientific adviser, Prof Ian Boyd, met for the first time earlier in June to identify gaps in knowledge about the state of the UK's pollinators. De Mauley noted existing government initiatives including 12 new Nature Improvement Areas to create more and better-connected habitats at a landscape scale and the promotion and funding of the sowing of nectar flower mixes on farmland. On pesticides, he said: \"I do not deny for a moment that it is important to regulate pesticides effectively and to avoid unnecessary pesticide use. However, we all know that bees will be vulnerable, whether or not we put more restrictions on insecticides.\" Pressure on the government to act has grown rapidly in recent months and included calls from over 200 MPs, businesses including Marks and Spencers. B&Q and the Co-operative and 70,000 members of the public. Lynne Dicks, an expert on wild pollinators at the University of Cambridge , said enhancing the food and nesting sites available to pollinators was one key problem that had to be addressed. \"All pollinators, not just bees but also many flies, butterflies, moths, wasps and beetles, rely on flowers,\" she said. \"But the number of flowers in the countryside declined calamitously in the 20th century: we lost 97% of our flower-rich meadows between 1930 and 1984.\" The Common Agricultural Policy should be used to restore grassland and planting more flowers on farmland, she said. \"Through enhancing the yield of many high value crops, pollination is worth between £430m and £510 m to the UK economy,\" Dicks said. \"But amazingly, pollination doesn't seem to be considered as an important agricultural input.\"  She added that basic monitoring of pollinators was lacking: \"At the moment, it is almost impossible for us to know whether actions to help bees and flies are having an effect, because we have no long-term monitoring.\" Finally she said overall pesticide use must be reduced, rather than increasing as it did by 6.5% between 2005 and 2010. The government's national action plan on pesticides, published in March, was required to establish timetables and targets for reductions but did not. Paul de Zylva, at Friends of the Earth, said: \"This was more of an inaction plan.\"\n",

      "Text: The impact of China’s clean air and renewable energy policies are beginning to have an impact on the country’s coal industry, according to reports suggesting domestic coal production fell last year. State media reported on Monday that coal production fell in 2014 for the first time this century, with production totalling 3.5bn tonnes between January and November representing a 2.1% fall on the same period in 2013. The China National Coal Association (CNCA) predicted that full year production will fall 2.5% year-on-year. Meanwhile, Jiang Zhimin vice president at the CNCA, told news agency Xinhua that the sector expected production to decline by a further 2.5% this year. The industry maintains that it has been hit by a number of one-off factors, such as high rainfall leading to high levels of hydro-electric production that has in turn impacted demand for coal. Similarly, government restrictions on the export of low-quality coal hit a market that was already suffering as coal prices fell by around 20%. However, Xinhua acknowledged that much of the pressure on the coal industry is the result of demanding new environmental regulations from the Chinese government and increased investment in renewable energy, that has made China the world’s largest investor in clean technologies. The news agency said that between 2005 and 2013 emissions per unit of GDP fell 29% in China, while new figures suggest a further drop of 4.8% was achieved last year as investment in clean energy infrastructure continued to soar.\n",

      "Text: If Liz Truss is looking to give her leadership a new start, a cross-party group of MPs has suggested some answers, in the form of a 10-point wishlist for climate and nature. Tripling the capacity of floating offshore windfarms, restoring 30% of the UK’s saltmarshes and seagrass meadows, and expanding the existing energy company obligation to make more homes efficient, are among the recommendations by the MPs on the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on the environment. Most of the measures could be taken easily and with support across parliament, their new report, published on Tuesday, suggests. Some are technical, such as expanding the Treasury’s tax breaks on investment to cover skills and non-physical capital, and cutting VAT on public electric vehicle charging points from 20% to 5%. The MPs are also calling on the prime minister to create a net-zero devolution deal to cover all the UK’s devolved governments, and to use the Environment Act to introduce ambitious targets on the restoration of the natural environment. A new office for carbon removal should regulate carbon offsetting, and there should be more funding to help farmers cut their greenhouse gas emissions. Truss’s determination to deregulate, by sweeping away environmental protections and planning regulations, has earned her the ire of the UK’s conservation groups. But the new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has indicated a willingness to rip up measures in the previous mini-budget, and U-turns on Downing Street’s deregulatory zeal could win them back over. Beccy Speight, the chief executive of RSPB, said: “Tackling the nature and climate crisis needs strong and bold global leadership, but this must start at home. The simple fact is that without ambitious and long-term targets for nature’s recovery, the government can’t possibly deliver on its own environmental promises. Investing in and growing our network of protected areas, and making sure they are maintained and enhanced for wildlife and people, is an essential step and one that mustn’t be delayed or discarded.” The cross-party group of MPs has the backing of nature and environment charities, as well as the renewable energy and electric vehicle industries, and many in local government. Alan Whitehead, the Labour MP and an environment APPG vice-chair, said insulation must be a priority as the government grapples with the cost of living crisis. “Expensive fossil fuels are leaving UK homes cold and destroying the planet. We need a retrofit revolution to permanently bring down energy bills and carbon emissions whilst creating jobs across the country,” he said. The energy company obligation, under which households on the lowest incomes can have a variety of energy efficiency measures installed, was boosted by £1bn over three years by the last chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng. But Hunt could do much more, the APPG found. Whitehead said: “Expanding the energy company obligation to improve the energy efficiency of homes for middle- and low-income households is a basic first step we can take that would allow that change to begin.” Transport must also play a key role, according to Alexander Stafford, a Conservative MP and another vice-chair of the group. “The UK is on the edge of an electric vehicle revolution and the high rate of VAT on public charging marks a key barrier to speeding along the transition away from petrol and diesel. Equalising VAT to the same rate as private charging will be vital in improving access to affordable charging, and decarbonising transport.” Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, added that the prime minister must burnish the UK’s nature credentials before she travelled to the Cop15 biodiversity summit in Canada this December. “The UK has become one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world. If we are to halt and reverse the perilous decline in nature and destruction of wildlife, then the targets set under the Environment Act must not only be credible and comprehensive, but, crucially, delivered,” she said. “Not only must our prime minister attend [the Cop15] summit, but our UK delegation must come to the table ready to take serious action both at home and on the world stage.”\n",

      "Text: Marine biologists are racing to solve a unique problem which is crucial to their efforts to save the world's wild eel populations from catastrophic collapse: recreating a food called \"marine snow\". In one of the least-understood global conservation crises, spawning rates for the world's three major eel populations have crashed in the last three decades by as much as 99%, raising fears they could become extinct across the far east, Europe and north America. Biologists in Japan, where eels are an iconic part of the country's cuisine and culture, are on the brink of farming eels from birth to fork on an industrial scale for the first time, potentially in the same way as salmon is farmed worldwide. That breakthrough – being sought too by scientists in Korea and the United States – could dramatically relieve pressure on wild eel populations, and greatly increase the prospects of rebuilding their stocks worldwide. Yet the goal of producing wholly captive farmed eels, using larvae produced in captivity rather than wild-caught baby eels, is being thwarted by a very significant obstacle: reproducing the larvae's unique natural diet, which is known to scientists as \"marine snow\". That foodstuff, which is essential to an eel's growth cycle as they develop and mature from larvae to glass eels, is a mixture of marine detritus, organic waste matter suspended in diffuse clouds, which is proving extremely hard to reproduce on an industrial scale. Eels are being farmed commercially around the world but only by using baby eels trapped in the wild, adding even greater pressure to the last surviving wild populations. In the UK, young eel or elver numbers are now at 5% of their levels in the 1980s. Scientists have considered the most unlikely ingredients to help create that peculiar food, including the yolk from shark's eggs. To exacerbate the feeding problem, eels stay in a larval stage for three to four months, compared with only a few days for cod, and are extremely sensitive at that stage. Prof Katsumi Tsukamoto, a pioneer in eel conservation in the Pacific who was first discover the Pacific eels spawning grounds, told marine scientists in Edinburgh this week that this obstacle meant it cost €1,000 (£803) to produce a single captive seedling in the laboratory; their goal is to get that cost down to €1. Speaking after a keynote address to the World Fisheries Congress, Tsukamoto, from the Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute at Tokyo University, said the focus on devising a wholly self-sufficient domestic eel farming programme, while very expensive, was being driven by the need to preserve remaining wild eels. \"We're now trying to establish a special strain, completely cut off from wild stocks,\" he said. \"We want to improve the many different characteristics, for example growth rate, metamorphosis rates and disease resistance. It's a process of domestication, like sheep, pigs, cows or horses.\" Pressure to produce wholly captive eels is being driven by the continuing heavy demand from consumers: eels are the main ingredient in kabayaki, one of three most culturally important styles of Japanese cuisine along with sushi and tempura. David Righton, from the Cefas marine laboratory in Lowestoft, and a leading figure in the Eeliad project on saving the European eel, said the quest to find a substitute food stuff is one of the most competitive areas in eel conservation. \"Whoever gets there first has made a tremendous discovery; you're recovering a cultural tradition. Whoever does this is culturally important as well as becoming very rich,\" Righton said.\n",

      "Text: Australia is responsible for 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions and could be contributing as much as 17% by 2030 if the pollution from its fossil fuel exports is factored in, research says. Under climate accounting rules that record carbon dioxide released within a country, Australia is responsible for about 1.4% of global emissions. The analysis by science and policy institute Climate Analytics found more than twice that, another 3.6%, are a result of Australia’s coal, oil and gas exports. If all proposed fossil fuel developments went ahead, including Adani’s Carmichael mine, other proposed coal developments in the Galilee Basin and liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in Western Australia, and other countries adopted policies consistent with the Paris agreement, Australia could be linked to up to 17% of carbon pollution. The Australian Conservation Foundation, which commissioned the research, said this scenario showed Australia was on a path to being one of the worst contributors to a climate emergency. “Australia is now the number one exporter of both coal and gas and we are scheduled to push that off the charts in the next 10 years. We are looking to become an emissions super-power,” the foundation’s Gavan McFadzean said. “We are fortunate to have many of our emissions counted elsewhere but that doesn’t mean we’re not responsible for them.” There is no likelihood greenhouse accounting rules will change to reflect pollution embedded in exports but the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, has suggested Australia should get credit for the role he says the booming LNG industry is playing in lowering global emissions by displacing coal in Asia. Canada has made a similar claim and said it should be allowed under the Paris agreement. Taylor has not said if emissions from Australia’s coal exports should also be considered under this approach. Energy analysts say there is little evidence Australian LNG is displacing coal. A report last week by the government’s chief economist found in Japan, Australia’s biggest LNG market, gas was expected to face increasing competition from emissions-free nuclear and renewable energy. The Climate Analytics report says Australia’s support for new fossil fuel developments is at odds with its commitment to the 2015 Paris agreement goals of keeping global heating well below 2C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5C. Scientists say meeting the Paris goals will require fossil fuel emissions to peak soon, then decline rapidly. Average global temperatures are already about 1C hotter than pre-industrial levels. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Australia provides nearly 30% of coal and more than 20% of gas traded on global markets. Export earnings from the industries topped $117bn last financial year. In the wake of the Coalition’s election victory, both the government and opposition are supporting the opening of the Galilee coal basin in central Queensland, starting with the long-stalled Adani Carmichael mine. Coalition and Labor senators last week voted for a motion to this effect. Six mining proposals in the Galilee have been approved, but none has begun construction. Analysts have questioned whether these projects are viable given the lack of existing infrastructure, the cost of transporting the commodity hundreds of kilometres to an export port and uncertainty about coal’s future as the world moves to cleaner energy sources. While Australia’s emissions have risen each year since 2015, government greenhouse reports emphasise that per capita carbon pollution has fallen to its lowest level in 29 years. Climate Analytics says Australia remains one of the world’s highest emitters under this measure and if exported emissions were included the per head figure would leap from about 20 tonnes to nearly 70 tonnes a year each. Other countries that would have an increased responsibility for global emissions if fossil fuel exports were counted against the nation of origin would include Russia, the US, several countries in the Middle East and Indonesia.\n",

      "Text: Australia’s carbon emissions jumped at the start of 2017, the first time they have risen in the first few months of a year for more than a decade, according to projections produced exclusively for the Guardian. Emissions in the first three months of the year normally drop compared with the previous quarter, driven by seasonal factors and holidays. But in something not seen in since 2005, emissions rose in the first quarter of 2017 compared with the last quarter of 2016 by 1.54m tonnes of CO2, according to the study by consultants NDEVR Environmental. The rise was driven by increases in emissions from electricity generation. Government data on greenhouse gas emissions is released up to a full nine months after the end of a quarter. So NDEVR Environmental replicate the government data for the Guardian, releasing it about a month after the quarter finishes. The unseasonal rise in emissions continues a trend of rising national emissions which began in 2014 and which the government’s own modelling suggests will continue for decades to come, based on current policies. Matt Drum, the director of NDEVR Environmental, said the results showed a clear trend of rising emissions. The projections showed the recent jump was almost entirely driven by an increase in emissions from the electricity sector, with emissions from other sectors remaining stable or dropping.  Two thirds of the increased emissions from the electricity sector was driven by New South Wales, with most of the remainder coming from Queensland, said Stephen Christos, a consultant at NDEVR. Digging into the NSW figures further by examining data from the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo), Dylan McConnell from the University of Melbourne said the extra emissions appeared to be caused by unusually low generation from Snowy Hydro. Hydro generation in Australia was at its lowest levels in at least six years at the start of 2017, meaning demand needed to be met by dirtier sources of electricity. McConnell said it was possible hydro operators such as Snowy were “banking” their water supply ahead of shortfalls predicted by Aemo in the 2017-18 summer. In a rare move, Aemo has announced it wants to pay generators that are able to supply electricity at short notice to standby during that period, ready to meet the shortfall if needed. Gordon Wymer, the chief financial officer at Snowy Hydro, told the Guardian it generated less electricity in that period because of a mixture of water licensing issues and weather forecasts. “We could have generated more in calendar 2017, but we tend to be very conservative with our water management with respect to the downstream irrigators and other stakeholders,” Wymer said. “Just at the moment we are happiest with storages sitting on the high side – for this time of year, and with market conditions the way they are.” McConnell said the extra electricity used in Queensland could have been caused by the LNG industry. The latest projections show that Australia has emitted just over 23% of its carbon budget – the amount of carbon it can emit while doing its fair share to keep warming under 2C, according to the Climate Change Authority. Based on the rate of emissions over the past 12 months, that budget will be blown by 2031. On Friday, Australia’s chief scientist Alan Finkel will present his review of the national electricity market. It is expected to make a range of policy recommendations that will aim to reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions.\n",

      "Text: UK householders considering swapping their gas boiler for an electric heat pump could see how they work by visiting an early adopter in their area. A new service aims to help would-be heat pump owners to book a visit with households that already have one installed, through a website launched by the innovation charity Nesta. The site, VisitAHeatPump.com, allows users to locate one of 150 households that have signed up to host interested visitors to look at their low-carbon heating systems. Currently London and central Scotland have the highest concentration of heat pump hosts, while East Anglia is “becoming a heat pump hotspot” with 11 hosts advertising on the platform so far, Nesta says. Katy King, a director at Nesta, said the service would make it easier for prospective heat pump owners to see how the devices worked in a real-life setting, and ask any questions they may have. “We hope that if more people can see heat pumps in real-life settings, then more people will have confidence that a heat pump is the right fit to heat their home,” she said. “Changing the way we heat our homes is one of the most meaningful things we can do to cut carbon emissions. Many homeowners are keen to make green improvements but don’t get the opportunity to see how low-carbon technologies, such as heat pumps, work in action.” The government has identified heat pumps as a crucial technology to help cut carbon emissions from heating, which makes up more than a third of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Ministers aim to have 600,000 pumps installed a year by 2028, but take-up has been hampered by high costs and scepticism of the new technology. In response, the government has increased its grant scheme to £7,500 to help bring down costs to levels more comparable to conventional gas boilers. Martin Callanan, the minister for energy efficiency and green finance, said: “This fantastic new service will help families work out whether a heat pump is right for them, and we’ll continue supporting households to make the switch with our £7,500 grant. We already know that heat pumps are three times more efficient than gas boilers and demand is soaring, with applications to our boiler upgrade scheme up 75% on last February,” he said.\n",

      "Text: The grownups have finally won and everyone in the UK, from those in cold homes to those on polluted streets and in flooded towns, will benefit. The most important aspect of the UK government’s new clean growth strategy is its unequivocal statement that tackling climate change and a prosperous economy are one and the same thing. This has been clear to many for some time, including Philip Hammond, if not his predecessor George Osborne. There is no long-term, high-carbon economic strategy because the impacts of unchecked climate change destroy economies, as Lord Nicholas Stern puts it. But the Conservative party has long been swinging between the green dream and fossil-fuelled fantasies. David Cameron went from pledging the “greenest government ever” to dismissing the “green crap” in three years. Recent years have seen one green policy shredded after another, destroying confidence among the businesses we need to deliver a low-carbon economy. The new strategy published on Thursday signals a new, if belated, beginning. It is the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel age: it is highly notable that the government plan omits any mention of fracking, having previously been its cheerleader. The government had to produce this plan under its own climate laws to explain how it will get on track to meet the nation’s legally binding carbon targets in 2030 and beyond. But ministers have rightly made a virtue of the plan’s necessity. The proposals themselves are ambitious but lack concrete suggestions in many areas. However, ambition always precedes action and there are plenty of groups, not least the government’s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, who will hold ministers to account. If the government’s efforts to cut emissions from buildings have been slow, it is now taking seriously the need to address energy efficiency. Energy that isn’t used – negawatts – are by far the cheapest way to cut both emissions and energy bills. But as the vast failure of the green deal showed, efficiency is hard to make happen and it is here where firm plans are most urgently needed. Along with heating, transport also needs urgent action – emissions here have been rising. There is plenty in the new plan to harness the surging market for electric vehicles, though little of it is new. Ministers have also once again failed to explain how expanding aviation with Heathrow’s third runway fits with its climate change plan. Electric cars will need clean power and the UK’s electricity grid is already greening fast – coal power has fallen from 40% to 2% in the last five years. The new plan rightly builds on the UK’s success in dramatically driving down the cost of offshore wind power, yet it all but ignores an even cheaper source – onshore wind. It seems that even the conviction that the green economy is the UK’s future is not enough to face down the rural Tory-voting minority who continue to tilt at windmills. Solar power also seems destined to suffer the same fate. Despite looking these gift horses in the mouth, and ignoring tidal power, the plan promises yet more cash for those with their snouts in the nuclear trough. The hyper-expensive Hinkley Point farce has not dulled the appetite for more new nuclear power and it intends to plough by far the biggest sum of its innovation funding into the one energy technology where costs are always rising. But the biggest worry is the very limited support for carbon capture and storage, the technology that takes emissions from fossil fuels and buries them under the ground. CCS is seen as absolutely vital by the Committee on Climate Change, the National Audit Office and the UN’s climate science panel and the UK’s emptying North Sea fields are perfectly placed carbon reservoirs. But CCS gets only about a quarter of the investment of nuclear and just a tenth of the £1bn promised in the plan so abruptly canned by Osborne in 2015. Trees are natural carbon stores and the new plan pledges to “establish a new network of forests in England, including new woodland on farmland”, which offers a tantalising glimpse of the radical change to farm subsidies that may follow Brexit. But there is no mention of the reduction in meat consumption deemed essential in beating global warming by scientists. However, while many of the details are missing, the clean growth strategy marks an important and vital step forward for the UK. As the prime minister Theresa May says in the plan’s foreword: “Clean growth is not an option, but a duty we owe to the next generation. Success in this mission will improve our quality of life and increase our economic prosperity.” The strategy is now crystal clear – it is time to deliver.\n",

      "Text: The world’s largest food companies, whose products have been linked to the widespread destruction of rainforests, have failed to come up with an adequate strategy to align their business practices with the 1.5C climate target, according to campaigners. The leading producers of soya beans, palm oil, cocoa and cattle published their roadmap to align with 1.5C earlier this week, promising to develop and publish commodity-specific, time-bound targets on stopping deforestation which will be backed by science and checked each year. The companies include the Brazilian beef firm JBS, the American agricultural firm Cargill and the Singaporean food processing firm Wilmar International. Land use change is the second biggest driver of global heating behind burning fossil fuels and the biggest cause of biodiversity loss, while halting the destruction of rainforests is a key part of tackling the climate and biodiversity crises. To comply with 1.5C, all land use conversion must stop by 2030 with significant progress made by the middle of the decade, according to scientists. While campaigners acknowledge some progress has been made, especially with palm oil, they argue the companies have largely failed to deliver on the ambition they promised on soya and beef. The disagreement between campaigners and companies is about the date by which firms should stop deforestation. Cristiane Mazzetti, a senior forest campaigner at Greenpeace Brazil, said some of the companies had previously promised to rid deforestation from their supply chains by 2020 and had failed. “We cannot afford any more greenwashing or reckless behaviour from these companies who profit from the destruction of ecosystems and come up with more delays and inadequate plans to halt and reverse the destruction they drive that will continue to fry the planet,” she said. Malaysia and Indonesia, home to most of the world’s palm oil sector, have had success at reducing deforestation in recent years, in part because of better regulation. Nico Muzi, managing director of the environmental group Madre Brava, said the plan announced at Cop27 did amount to some progress but said the commitment fell short of what was needed, especially in the meat sector. “There are two flagrant omissions: a cutoff date to stop soy-driven deforestation now, and the exclusion of conversion by cattle and soy expansion of the largest savanna region in South America, Brazil’s Cerrado,” she said. André Vasconcelos, of Global Canopy, said the plan was encouraging as the companies involved represented more than 60% of Brazilian soy exports, 50% of Brazilian beef and 45% of Indonesia’s palm oil exports in 2020, although some of the main producers were missing. But he added that the companies needed to go further for the plan to be credible. “Tackling deforestation is integral to staying under 1.5C,” he said. “Traders need to go further, faster. The roadmap needs a proactive stance towards avoiding future deforestation and conversion, including a concrete commitment not to invest in further infrastructural development in key deforestation frontiers. There needs to be a commitment to a common cutoff date across commodities that includes all types of ecosystems.” Jack Hurd, the executive director of the Tropical Forest Alliance helping oversee the roadmap through the World Economic Forum, said he disagreed that not enough progress had been made and said he was particularly pleased with movement in the cattle industry. “These companies often deal in one or more of the commodities. It is important to remember that. We are working across several sectors. The main plus is the oil palm sector. It has done very well and laid a clear path to 1.5C.  “Our view is that the soy sector has room to grow. The cattle sector has some plans that are aligned with 1.5C. The science says that deforestation and all land use change has to end by 2030, with significant reductions by 2025. In our view, they have made a big step in priority biomes,” he said. Wilmar International, a major palm oil supplier, emphasised the success of this sector in reducing deforestation, and added: “Each commodity sector has varying commitments and indicators – some more comprehensive and progressive than others. The criticism drawn thus far has incorrectly and unfairly consolidated all the commodity sectors towards the lowest commitment.” Cargill and JBS did not respond to a request for comment.

      "Text: World leaders gathered for Cop26 must ban industrial fishing on the high seas to have a chance of preserving the ocean, the Earth’s “largest carbon-capturing and oxygen-generating system”, the deep-sea explorer and oceanographer Sylvia Earle has said. Earle, 86, has clocked up more than 7,000 hours underwater and holds several records, including in 1979 for the deepest untethered dive by a woman. She was at Cop26 in Glasgow this week, taking part in events with Al Gore, John Kerry and Zac Goldsmith, as well as young climate activists at the Ocean Action Hub. Stopping industrial fishing in international waters, Earle said, was as important as curbing fossil fuel use. “It’s the No 1 priority, because we have the chance, in a stroke, to safeguard the blue heart of the planet,” she said. “It’s where most of the oxygen that comes from the ocean is generated. It’s where most of the carbon is taken up.” The exponential growth in industrial fishing is blamed for an alarming drop in marine life in the last half century. A third of commercial fish populations are being harvested at biologically unsustainable levels, according to a 2018 report by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. “All of that wildlife taken out of the ocean not only affects biodiversity and fosters extinctions at an accelerated rate. It breaks the carbon cycle – the nutrient chain that maintains the fabric of life on Earth,” she said. The pioneering marine biologist from New Jersey made history in 1970 with Mission 6, when she and an all-female team of scientists spent two weeks in Nasa’s underwater laboratory in the US Virgin Islands, Tektite II, to study aquatic life as well as the psychology of a small crew in extreme conditions, as part of Nasa’s research for sending humans to the moon. She operated deep-sea research submarines in the 1980s and served as the first female chief scientist of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In 1998 Time Magazine named her its first Hero for the Planet. “It is frustrating to be able to see the future so clearly, from having spent years at sea, and thousands of hours under the sea, and to realise that so many people can’t see it,” she said. “The climate scientists are saying: ‘Listen up, we’ve got about 10 years, to make or break our behaviour toward nature.” Earle noted that just five nations were “benefiting disproportionately on an industrial scale from the wild animals that live [in international waters]”. China and Taiwan account for 60% of distant-water fishing, while Japan, South Korea, and Spain make up about 10% each, according to a 2019 report by the Stimson Center. “Only a small segment of the human population truly relies on ocean life for sustenance,” said Earle. “Many more rely on it for money, using wild animals as a source of revenue.” She argued that the coastal communities who survived on fishing could do so within national waters, and compared fishing the high seas to killing elephants for ivory or rhinoceroses for their horns. Industrial fishing was “cutting slashes in the web of life” by destroying fish populations around the world, she said. Worldwide, 3 billion people rely on wild-caught or farmed seafood as their main source of animal protein, particularly in coastal communities and small-island states, according to the WWF. Earle is also president of Mission Blue, an organisation that aims to establish marine protected areas (MPA) around the world. She hailed last week’s announcement at Cop26 of a new “mega-MPA”, linking the waters of Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, and Costa Rica, but said the signatories of the “30x30” initiative – to secure at least 30% of the world’s ocean as marine protected areas by 2030 – needed to step up. “We must protect nature as if our lives depend on it,” she said, adding: “Achieving 30% of full protection for land and sea … doesn’t mean we can trash the rest.” She said the Covid-19 pandemic had helped give people a greater appreciation of nature and realise that what affects one affects us all. “We are equipped with the superpower of knowing,” said Earle. “We are one species with an oversized impact, an oversized responsibility and I’d say an oversized opportunity to take what we now know and act.” Earle, a vegetarian who says she has not eaten fish for at least four decades, called the ocean a “living system, a biogeochemical miracle, that keeps us safe in a universe that doesn’t have a built-in life support system. “We have abused it, thinking that it’s infinite in its capacity to recover – no matter what we put in, what we take out.”\n",

      "Text: A US congressional committee has invited board members at four large oil companies to testify in February about the industry’s role in the climate crisis and spreading “disinformation”, turning up the heat on big oil after lawmakers grilled their CEOs last year. The hearing of officials from Exxon, Shell, Chevron and BP, scheduled for 8 February, is the next phase of the House oversight committee’s investigation into the role of fossil fuel companies in blocking action on climate change and misrepresenting the industry’s efforts to address it. The panel had concluded the first of these hearings last October, which featured the oil company CEOs, by issuing subpoenas for documents on company scientists’ statements about the climate crisis and any funds spent to mislead the public on global heating. By turning its focus to board members who were elected to spur change at these companies on the climate crisis, the committee plans to scrutinize corporate pledges to cut emissions and invest in cleaner sources of energy. “These are board members who ran on changing these institutions from the inside,” chair of the oversight panel’s environment subcommittee, Ro Khanna, told Reuters. “They will have to chose between their life convictions or fealty to their CEOs.” Among the board members selected to testify is Alexander Karsner, a strategist at Google owner Alphabet Inc who won one of three seats for the activist hedge fund Engine No 1 to Exxon’s board to address growing investor concerns about global warming. The committee also sent a letter to Susan Avery, an atmospheric scientist and former president of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was brought on to Exxon’s board in 2017 as a climate expert. The letters said board members play an important governance role in addressing the climate crisis “by overseeing and guiding companies’ climate strategies, promoting transparency and holding management accountable to meaningful emissions reductions. Each of the four companies invited to the hearing has announced net zero emission targets by 2050 and have claimed that their plans are aligned with the goals of the Paris agreement. The panel will focus on the fact that the companies’ net zero plans are mostly focused on their internal operations, not on the emissions released when consumers burn the fossil fuels they produce. For example, Exxon earlier this week announced a net zero plan focused on its operations – not on “scope three” emissions from consumers who buy their products. An Exxon spokesperson, Casey Norton, did not comment on the new hearing but said the company has “provided staff with more than 200,000 pages of documents, including board materials and internal communications”. The board members were not immediately available for comment.\n",

      "Text: The EU has \"washed its hands\" of an invasion of snails in a Spanish river delta that are destroying crops and threaten to spread into other southern European wetlands, farmers say. Rice-growers in the Ebro Delta on southern Catalonia's Mediterranean coast have reported losing up to half of their crops since the island apple snail (Pomacea insularum) was first seen in 2009. The worst-affected fields have 12 snails per square metre, with each snail capable of eating the roots of up to 15 rice plants each day. Authorities are attempting to destroy the snails by drying out their fields over winter and flooding some with salt water. The EU has supported the experiment by sharing the cost with the Spanish and Catalonian governments. But it will recoup €378,000 of this money from the delta's struggling farmers. The EU pays farmers a subsidy to keep their fields flooded during the winter months and preserve wetland habitat for birds and fish. The EU gave growers permission to drain 7,000 hectares of fields this winter, but this meant losing their subsidies. \"The EU has washed its hands of the problem,\" said Albert Pons, a rice farmer from the delta village of Camarles. \"I have spent hours and hours setting up systems to catch and eliminate the snail, cleaning out filters and irrigation channels and physically searching for and killing the snails one at a time.\" The Ebro River's delta of rice fields and wetlands provide habitat and breeding sites for a large range of bird species. More than 7,000 hectares is protected under the Ramsar convention on wetlands. The wetlands currently remain free of the snail. The European Food Safety Authority (Efsa) says the snails could destroy wetland ecosystems if they spread across southern Europe. The vice-chair of Efsa's panel on plant health, Joop van Lenteren, said juvenile snails, only millimetres across, could attach to the feathers of migrating birds and spread to wetlands hundreds of kilometres away. The hulls of local fishing boats could be covered with eggs, raising concerns the snail could hitch a ride to other waterways. Efsa research indicates that the snail could thrive in large parts of Spain, southern France, Italy and Greece and the Danube. If this happens, the snail could push already fragile ecosystems into irreversible decline as it has done in Thailand and other countries in south-east Asia. \"When the snail establishes in rivers and wetlands the consequences can be serious. Because it is so voracious, there is a high risk to biodiversity,\" he said. According to tthe Global Invasive Species Database, the snails have an ability to reproduce at extraordinary rates. Between April and November, females will lay 400 bright pink eggs every five to 15 days. Pons said when the snail first appeared on his farmland, he did not realise what an insidious threat it posed. \"I first saw the snail in an irrigation channel in 2010. The following year we found them in my rice fields. This last year has been catastrophic and our struggle to remove or control them [is] extremely expensive. \"The plague has spread like wildfire. Now farmers and the public bodies cannot keep up with it. Seeing the extent of the damage, I feel anxiety for the future of my livelihood and family,\" said Pons. The South American species is a popular aquarium pet because of its size and can grow as big as an apple. Its release into the Ebro has been linked with Promotora Bama, an exotic animal importer, which bred the snails at a facility in the village of L'Aldea on the north side of the delta. The snails were first detected in a drainage channel in the town. Shortly afterwards, the company relocated its facility to the town of Tarragona, 80km to the north. Promotora Bama, who were unavailable for comment, were taken to court by the Catalonian government in 2012 but a judge dismissed the action because it had passed the three-year statute of limitations. Efsa said the snails in the delta had genetic traits consistent with cultivation in the pet industry. In November 2012, the EU banned the import of all snails in the genus pomacea. An European commission spokesperson said: \"The commission is very concerned about the economic and environmental damage caused by the apple snail and for that reason, under the EU plant health legislation, the snails of the genus pomacea are subject to emergency measures to prevent its introduction into and the spread within the Union.\" The EU has made €2.64m available to the Spanish authorities from 2010 until 2013 for control actions against the harmful organism. But the EU says the subsidy contracts farmers received for flooding their fields, which were suspended during 2013, expired at the end of last year and would not be reinstated because the fields no longer represent good habitat for birds. \"The commission does not consider appropriate to extend these commitments until 2014, given the economic and environmental damage caused by the apple snail.\"\n",

      "Text: The president of Cop28, Sultan Al Jaber, has claimed there is “no science” indicating that a phase-out of fossil fuels is needed to restrict global heating to 1.5C, the Guardian and the Centre for Climate Reporting can reveal. Al Jaber also said a phase-out of fossil fuels would not allow sustainable development “unless you want to take the world back into caves”. The comments were “incredibly concerning” and “verging on climate denial”, scientists said, and they were at odds with the position of the UN secretary general, António Guterres. Al Jaber made the comments in ill-tempered responses to questions from Mary Robinson, the chair of the Elders group and a former UN special envoy for climate change, during a live online event on 21 November. As well as running Cop28 in Dubai, Al Jaber is also the chief executive of the United Arab Emirates’ state oil company, Adnoc, which many observers see as a serious conflict of interest. More than 100 countries already support a phase-out of fossil fuels and whether the final Cop28 agreement calls for this or uses weaker language such as “phase-down” is one of the most fiercely fought issues at the summit and may be the key determinant of its success. Deep and rapid cuts are needed to bring fossil fuel emissions to zero and limit fast-worsening climate impacts. Al Jaber spoke with Robinson at a She Changes Climate event. Robinson said: “We’re in an absolute crisis that is hurting women and children more than anyone … and it’s because we have not yet committed to phasing out fossil fuel. That is the one decision that Cop28 can take and in many ways, because you’re head of Adnoc, you could actually take it with more credibility.” Al Jaber said: “I accepted to come to this meeting to have a sober and mature conversation. I’m not in any way signing up to any discussion that is alarmist. There is no science out there, or no scenario out there, that says that the phase-out of fossil fuel is what’s going to achieve 1.5C.” Robinson challenged him further, saying: “I read that your company is investing in a lot more fossil fuel in the future.” Al Jaber responded: “You’re reading your own media, which is biased and wrong. I am telling you I am the man in charge.” Al Jaber then said: “Please help me, show me the roadmap for a phase-out of fossil fuel that will allow for sustainable socioeconomic development, unless you want to take the world back into caves.” “I don’t think [you] will be able to help solve the climate problem by pointing fingers or contributing to the polarisation and the divide that is already happening in the world. Show me the solutions. Stop the pointing of fingers. Stop it,” Al Jaber said. Guterres told Cop28 delegates on Friday: “The science is clear: The 1.5C limit is only possible if we ultimately stop burning all fossil fuels. Not reduce, not abate. Phase out, with a clear timeframe.” Bill Hare, the chief executive of Climate Analytics, said: “This is an extraordinary, revealing, worrying and belligerent exchange. ‘Sending us back to caves’ is the oldest of fossil fuel industry tropes: it’s verging on climate denial.” “Al Jaber is asking for a 1.5C roadmap – anyone who cares can find that in the International Energy Agency’s latest net zero emissions scenario, which says there cannot be any new fossil fuel development. The science is absolutely clear [and] that absolutely means a phase-out by mid-century, which will enhance the lives of all of humanity.” Prof Sir David King, the chair of the Climate Crisis Advisory Group and a former UK chief scientific adviser, said: “It is incredibly concerning and surprising to hear the Cop28 president defend the use of fossil fuels. It is undeniable that to limit global warming to 1.5C we must all rapidly reduce carbon emissions and phase-out the use of fossil fuels by 2035 at the latest. The alternative is an unmanageable future for humanity.” Dr Friederike Otto, of Imperial College London, UK, said: “The science of climate change has been clear for decades: we need to stop burning fossil fuels. A failure to phase out fossil fuels at Cop28 will put several millions more vulnerable people in the firing line of climate change. This would be a terrible legacy for Cop28.” Otto also rejected the claim that fossil fuels were necessary for development in poorer countries, saying that the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change “shows that the UN’s sustainable development goals are not achievable by continuing the current fossil-driven high emission economies. [There are] massive co-benefits that come with changing to a fossil-free world”. A spokesperson for Cop28 said: “The IEA and IPCC 1.5C scenarios clearly state that fossil fuels will have to play a role in the future energy system, albeit a smaller one. The Cop president was quoting the science, and leading climate experts. “He has clearly said that the oil and gas industry must tackle scope 1 and 2 emissions [from their operations], must invest in clean energy and clean technologies to address scope 3 emissions [from burning fuels], and that all industry must align around keeping the north star of 1.5C within reach. “Once again, this is clearly part of a continued effort to undermine the Cop presidency’s tangible achievements and a misrepresentation of our position and successes to date.” The spokesperson said the presidency had operationalised the loss and damage fund with more than $700m, launched a $30bn private market climate vehicle, and brought 51 oil companies to agree decarbonisation targets and 119 countries to sign a pledge to triple renewable energy. “This is just the beginning,” the spokesperson said. Al Jaber is also head of Masdar, the UAE’s renewable energy company, but his appointment as Cop28 president has been controversial. Shortly before the summit, leaked documents showed that the UAE had planned to use climate meetings with governments to promote oil and gas deals. Al Jaber denied having seen or used the talking points in the documents. Adnoc also has the largest net-zero-busting expansion plans for oil and gas, according to independent analysis. The issue of a phase-out or phase-down is complicated by the terms not having agreed definitions and by the highly uncertain role of technologies to “abate” emissions, such as carbon capture and storage. “Keeping the Paris agreement targets alive will require a full fossil fuel phase-out, not a vague phase-down relying on unproven technologies,” said Otto. More than 100 African, European, Pacific and Caribbean countries back a phase-out of unabated fossil fuels. The US, the world’s biggest oil and gas producer, also backs a phase-out. Others, such as Russia, Saudi Arabia and China, reject the call. Both options are on the table at Cop28, as well as proposals to only mention coal, or to not say anything at all about fossil fuels. Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021 agreed for the first time to “phase down” coal use, but this had been watered down from “phase out” at the last minute, bringing the Cop26 president, Alok Sharma, to tears. In his conversation with Robinson, Al Jaber also said: “A phase-down and a phase-out of fossil fuel in my view is inevitable. That is essential. But we need to be real serious and pragmatic about it.” “Hold on. Let me just explain,” he said. “The world will continue to need energy sources. We [UAE] are the only ones in the world today that have been decarbonising the oil and gas resources. We have the lowest carbon intensity.” This refers to the emissions from the energy used to extract fossil fuels, not the far larger emissions from burning the fuels. “There is no such thing as ‘low carbon’ or ‘lower carbon’ oil and gas,” said Otto. Numerous commentators have said that negative or embarrassing revelations about Al Jaber and Adnoc increase the pressure on him to deliver a strong Cop28 deal. The Guardian reported recently that state-run UAE oil and gas fields had been flaring gas almost daily despite having committed 20 years ago to a policy of zero routine flaring. The Guardian previously reported that Adnoc had been able to read emails to and from the Cop28 office until the Guardian raised the issue in June and that the UAE had also failed to report its oil industry’s emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane. Harjeet Singh, at Climate Action Network, said: “Cop28 must deliver a decision on phasing out fossil fuels in a just and equitable manner, without any loopholes or escape routes for the industry to continue expanding and exacerbating the climate crisis.”  Cop28: Can fossil fuel companies transition to clean energy?   On Tuesday 5 December, 8pm-9.15pm GMT, join Damian Carrington, Christiana Figueres, Tessa Khan and Mike Coffin for a livestreamed discussion on whether fossil fuel companies can transition to clean energy.

      "Text: Greenhouse gas emissions from road transport in Australia have nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels, exposing the country’s lack of policies to decarbonise the sector, new analysis shows. But the amount of electricity being generated from renewable sources such as solar and wind continues to break records, with October seeing almost one-third of electricity being generated by clean sources. Energy data analysed for the Australia Institute’s regular National Energy Emissions Audit shows the pandemic’s main effect on emissions was in the transport sector as people travelled less and stayed at home. Lockdowns saw emissions from road transport plummet in the early part of 2020 but then start to rise sharply again towards September to almost reaching parity with previous years. One exception was Victoria, where emissions from transport fell again in line with the state’s second-wave lockdowns as Covid-19 cases peaked in August. In the year to June 2020, the audit suggests the drop in the use of petrol and diesel mainly for road transport, together with a decline in aviation fuel, saw a reduction of about 5.4mt of CO2e compared to an average year. Victoria saw the biggest drop in road transport emissions of 2.4mt from April to September 2020 compared with the same period in 2019. The analysis is produced for the institute by energy expert Hugh Saddler from Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy. Richie Merzian, the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, told Guardian Australia the government had supported the fossil fuel industry during the pandemic with subsidies for refineries. “There seems to be no shortage of support for the existing fossil fuel industry in transport,” Merzian said. “But when it comes to reducing demand for fossil fuels the government is nowhere.” In October, the federal energy minister, Angus Taylor, announced the government was investing $2oom to build new diesel storage and would pay Australian refineries one cent for each litre of petrol, diesel or jet fuel produced. Both Victoria and South Australia have announced plans for a new tax on electric vehicles, which experts have warned will discourage their uptake in a country already lagging the world on electric cars. Electric car sales are increasing in Australia but were just 0.6% of new car sales in 2019 compared to other developed countries where sales are between 2.5% and 5%. The Morrison government has been working on a strategy that morphed from one expected to focus on electric vehicles to a “future fuels strategy”. A draft of the plan leaked earlier this month was attacked by the electric vehicles industry which said the government had spent 18 months coming up with a “nothing” strategy. Britain has announced a ban on sales of new fossil fuel cars from 2030 with Japan to follow in 2035. Norway has set a 2025 deadline. “Australia remains highly reliant on fossil fuels for transport,” said Merzian. “The only real policy it has [to reduce emissions] is a pandemic. The lesson learned here is that we have to lower the demand for fossil fuels, not just secure supply which seems to be the focus for the energy minister.” A fall in the use of coal and gas to generate electricity up to October 2020 coincided with an increased share from renewable energy, the audit finds. Through October renewables were responsible for a record high 31.5% of electricity generation across Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia – the five states that form the National Electricity Market. On 2 October, renewables supplied a record-high 38.3% of electricity in the national market and the following day saw a 30-minute period where renewables supplied 53.8% of electricity – another record. Merzian said as the electricity network became less polluting there was a stronger argument to increase the numbers of electric vehicles on roads – many of which would be charged from the grid.\n",

      "Text: I am hugely disappointed to see John Vidal suggesting that slowing population growth can help solve the climate crisis, when he fully acknowledges that the rich generate orders of magnitude more emissions than the poor (It should not be controversial to say a population of 8 billion will have a grave impact on the climate, 15 November). Population growth will cause many problems, not least increased resource consumption, but our ability to “solve” climate change in the here and now has nothing to do with future population growth because of the relative timescales involved. To argue otherwise is not controversial, it is merely wrong. We have less than 10 years to bend the curve downwards on emissions, whereas doing the same with population is impossible. As the late Swedish academic Hans Rosling made clear, global heating is the fault of the overconsumption of the richest billion people on Earth and the next richest billion trying to adopt the same way of life. It has very little to do with the poorest billions, where future population growth is concentrated. Solving global heating will only be possible through a rapid transition of the energy economy by the rich, and an adoption of those technologies by the poor in due course – something that fossil fuel countries and companies do not want us to do. We absolutely need to improve the health, education and rights of women and children to help bend down the curve of population growth. But we must not be deluded into thinking that that helps us in the current transition of our energy economy, without which any population reduction in 50-100 years is simply too late. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change “consensus” on population that Vidal refers to is weakened by the knowledge that the fossil fuel lobby is intense within the UN process, and attempting to refocus attention away from an energy transition and on to population is precisely what it wants in order to achieve further delay. We must continue to focus on removing fossil fuels from our economies, because if we don’t, even if the population stood still, we would blast past 3C degrees of heating in the next 78 years regardless. In the time constraint we have, population growth is an irrelevance.Ian BrownLondon  John Vidal compares the energy use of the wealthiest 10% to the poorest 10% (about 20 times). But it is not only energy that is overconsumed disproportionately by us – it is meat, cement, plastics, timber, lithium, clothes, etc. Most of the population growth is happening in underdeveloped countries, so its impact on energy use will be small compared with usage in richer countries. In the study that Vidal refers to, it is noted that the energy consumption of someone in the poorest 20% of the UK is still higher than all but the top 16% wealthiest in India. Those numbers provide a clearer idea of where the largest impact is coming from. But the biggest problems are the trends: population growth is slowing and peaking, but our overconsumption of resources is constantly growing. One problem is diminishing (albeit slowly), the other is accelerating. It is clear that the planet can’t even sustain one billion of our environment-devouring western lifestyles. Perhaps we should clean up our backyard before we go preaching with a holier-than-thou attitude to other countries. Some of them are literally sinking because of us.Daniel RodriguezAsh Vale, Surrey   Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

      "Text: Last week, a Las Vegas news station interviewed Trump’s EPA administrator Scott Pruitt. The interviewer brought up the topic of climate change, and virtually everything Pruitt said in response was wrong, and was often refuted on his own agency’s website, until he started deleting it. To begin, Pruitt claimed that we don’t know ‘with precision’ what’s causing global warming. Here’s what the EPA website said about that a year ago, before Pruitt got a hold of it as part of the Trump Administration’s systematic deletion of government climate change websites: To support this statement, the EPA referenced the latest IPCC report. The IPCC concluded with 95% confidence that humans are the main cause of global warming since 1950, with a best estimate that humans are responsible for all of the global warming during that time. That’s what the scientific research has overwhelmingly concluded: Similarly, the EPA’s Student’s Guide to Climate Change (which has survived the Trump purge) says: Pruitt later shifted gears to repeat the third most popular climate myth: This is not a matter of assumptions – it’s a conclusion supported by a vast body of scientific research. The EPA website likewise tackled this one, until Pruitt got his hands on it: And the EPA’s Student’s Guide to Climate Change addresses it: The EPA’s Climate Change Indicators page likewise lists a number of dangerous climate change consequences. Quite simply, more intense droughts, floods, and hurricanes, and coastal inundation from sea level rise are all very bad outcomes. And even the rosiest analyses conclude that any further global warming will be bad for the economy. In fact, not only did Pruitt suggest the consequences of global warming won’t be bad, he seemed to think they’ll be good and humans will “flourish.” I asked climate scientists to answer this ‘ideal temperature’ question last month. They all agreed that the ideal climate is a stable one. Pruitt is wrong to say humans flourished during warming trends – we flourished during times of relatively flat temperatures without rapid trends. Climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe explained: Pruitt’s goal with these answers is clearly to manufacture doubt – to make people think that we needn’t take urgent action to slow global warming because the outcome might not be so bad. But that argument ignores the vast body of scientific evidence that clearly shows the net consequences of continued rapid climate change will fall somewhere in the range of bad to catastrophic. I summarized some of those consequences in this Denial101x lecture: Toward the end of the interview, Pruitt let slip his allegiance to the fossil fuel industry: First of all, under the Obama administration, the EPA regulated carbon pollution because it was legally required to do so under the Clean Air Act, according to the Supreme Court. That’s not being ‘weaponized’ against fossil fuels, it’s called enforcing the law to protect Americans’ health. Second, there is no reason why renewables couldn’t be the dominant fuel in our energy mix. In fact, several states have renewable portfolio standards and goals to make that happen. For example, Hawaii aims for 100% renewable energy by 2045, and California and New York have targets of 50% renewables by 2030. California is even ahead of schedule, on track to meet that goal a decade early, by 2020. As if his misinformation about climate science and clean energy weren’t bad enough, Pruitt really laid it on thick when asked about the Paris climate accords. In reality, the Paris agreement couldn’t have been a better deal. America needed only to follow through on existing climate policies to meet its Paris targets, and because the agreement is non-binding, there would be no consequence to missing the targets anyway. Moreover, because China and India are rapidly developing countries, cutting carbon pollution is much more difficult than in a developed country like the US. In fact, China pledged much more aggressive climate action than America in the Paris agreement. And it should go without saying that claiming the Paris climate agreement is “not about CO2 reduction” is utterly absurd nonsense. It bears remembering that Pruitt heads the Environmental Protection Agency. It’s easy to forget, since he seems to think it’s his job to undo as many regulations protecting the environment and public health as possible, and to maximize fossil fuel industry profits. That’s clear from his constant peddling of climate myths and misinformation. As climate scientist Michael Mann told The Guardian, “There is no consistency at all to their various arguments other than that we should continue to burn fossil fuels.” Pruitt isn’t in charge of the labor department or the pollution council or Koch Industries. His job is to protect human and environmental health, and it’s hard to imagine anyone doing the job any worse.\n",

      "Text: How does an iPad compare with other computers when it comes to environmental impact? Will I save electricity by using an iPad rather than a laptop? P Layton, by email First thing to say, thanks to TominAms and breadesign for pointing out that Greenpeace does not, as I stated in my opening gambit, \"attack\" the environmental performance of the iPad in its recent report. It does, though, discuss the wider issue of cloud computing, of which the iPad will, of course, play its part. It is the heralding of the iPad as a transformative technology – one that profoundly changes the way we use computers - that makes this particular debate so interesting. As has already been discussed below, we have to view the iPad's environmental impact in this context. Is it the long-fabled digital bridge that will lead us away from methods of content delivery that are reliant on dead trees, compact discs and cathode ray tubes? Or will it end up being just another example of disposable electronica that will keep us all amused for a couple of years before the Next Big Thing comes along (no doubt produced by Apple)? The short answer is none of us yet knows. But combined with the runaway success of smart phones (and netbooks, to some extent), it does appear that nimble, instant computing on the move is where we're heading. The days of being tied to a desktop computer, or even a laptop, seem to be receding. (Hallelujah to that.) GorillaPie makes the important point right from the start that iPads and their ilk could help to replace the printing of newspapers, magazines and books. Last year, a Finnish study calculated the carbon footprint of a newspaper, estimating that the average paper was responsible for 150–190 g CO2e. Meanwhile, Apple is claiming (pdf) that the total lifecycle emissions of an iPad (Wifi and 3G model) will come in at 130kg CO2e. (Roughly, that's equal to the per passenger emissions of a 1,000km flight.) The variables on both of these calculations are likely to be huge so I would take this all with a fistful of salt, but by comparing the two footprints you can see that, in greenhouse gas emissions alone, a switch over to devices such as the iPad could be a major benefit. But simonpieman9 makes a good point about the way in which we are all encouraged to move on to the next version of these gadgets the moment one is released. Just witness the number of iPods many people have gone through since the very first one came out in 2001. Is \"upgrading\" to a smaller, more energy-efficient device better than hanging on to your old, but still perfectly functional desktop or laptop? (We've had that particular debate with cars.) And, in reality, won't we all just use both? Here, again, TominAms (Tom Dowdall of Greenpeace International) makes some important observations: I think there's a long way to run with this debate before we'll ever know the definitive answer. But one thing seems certain: if we are to use iPads the way PhilipD intends to this summer whilst cycling through North America - namely, in isolation of all other technology - then we can be pretty certain that it would be better than having separate devices for each and every task.  Please send your own environment question to ask.leo.and.lucy@guardian.co.uk People in the UK will get the honour later this week of parting with 429 of their hard-earned pounds in return for an Apple iPad (well, the most basic version, anyway). As ever with Apple, the company has already made great play of the iPad's eco-credentials by publishing an environmental report (pdf). But regular Apple sparring partner Greenpeace has already used the product's launch to attack the environmental performance of the iPad and other such technological gadgetry. Where do you stand on this? Will you be rushing to the shops to grab your own iPad? Or maybe you already own one and have a view about, not only how much electricity it uses, but whether it has supplanted your use of other computers. And what about the iPad's embedded energy and recyclability? All views welcome in the comments below and, as ever, I'll return on Friday to join the discussion.\n",

      "Text: EDF energy is cutting scores of jobs to control costs at the site of its proposed new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset. The company is in the middle of difficult negotiations with ministers over the level of public subsidy the new reactors will receive over the next 40 years but insisted the project is not being mothballed and that it is not \"holding a gun to the government's head\". The company has already spent £800m on developing the £14bn project and lost its junior partner when Centrica pulled out in February. \"As part of good project management, and to control costs, EDF Energy has taken steps to refocus its activities at its Hinkley Point C project,\" said a spokeswoman. \"This reflects its priorities ahead of securing the financing necessary for the project.\" EDF refused to give the number of workers losing their jobs, citing ongoing consultations with staff and unions, but the Guardian understands it will be about 150 of the current 800-strong workforce. The company said further pre-construction planning work would continue but that preparation of the site had halted. EDF wants to build two new reactors at Hinkley. It says they would provide reliable and low-carbon electricity making up 7% of the UK's demand and provide 25,000 job opportunities during construction, with 900 long-term posts. The UK government has placed new nuclear reactors at the heart of its energy policy, to replace the ageing fleet of nuclear and coal plants which are being phased out. But the two sides have been unable to agree on the subsidy the plant would receive, paid for by consumers through their energy bills. EDF had originally said it would make its final investment decision by the end of 2012. Both sides have a great deal to lose, but as the negotiations have dragged on observers have suggested the likelihood of the government abandoning plans for a series of new nuclear plants. \"It is proving extremely difficult to get that first nuclear power plant built and there is an increasing feeling in industry that at £14bn a throw there is no chance of getting beyond one,\" said Lord Robin Teverson, the LibDem spokesman on energy in the House of Lords. A spokesman for the department of energy and climate change said: \"Progress is being made in our discussions with EDF. Both sides have an interest in reaching a positive agreement.\" EDF and the government face a number of major obstacles in delivering new reactors even beyond the challenging financing. The project has yet to be approved by the European Union, which limits the state aid that can be given to industrial projects. The UK also has no site for the long term disposal of nuclear waste, after the rejection of a proposal in Cumbria by local councils. Such a facility was considered a prerequisite for the building of new reactors by David Cameron before the 2010 election. The EDF spokeswoman said: \"The case for new nuclear in the UK remains as strong as ever.\" She said Ed Davey, the energy secretary had granted planning permission for Hinkley and that the reactor design has been approved by regulators. But a senior EDF executive said recently: \"We cannot afford to burn money every day, every week, every month without a clear understanding of where it's leading us.\"\n",

      "Text: This week marks 30 years since an accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine led to a huge leak of radiation across eastern Europe. The disaster is thought to have caused thousands of cancer cases. It was the only event classed as a “major accident” by the International Atomic Energy Agency until the 2011 meltdowns in Fukushima, Japan. The data demonstrates its impact: in the 32 years before Chernobyl, 409 reactors were opened, but only 194 have been connected in the three decades since. There were other factors in play, too. Yes, some of the change was directly down to the disaster in Ukraine. Italy, for example, voted in a referendum soon afterwards to stop producing nuclear energy. However, consultant nuclear engineer John Large says that regulations and transparency demands introduced in the wake of a 1979 meltdown at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania actually had a bigger impact. “Fukushima will have the same effect,” he says. The disaster in Japan prompted the German government to phase out its plants, with the last one closing in 2022. “Nuclear energy is failing because it is simply too expensive,” says Dr Paul Dorfman, senior research fellow at the Energy Institute, University College London. “If there’s another nuclear accident in the next five or 10 years, you can say goodbye to the industry.”\n",

      "Text: Emissions of the greenhouse gas methane from livestock are larger than previously thought, posing an additional challenge in the fight to curb global warming, scientists have said. Revised calculations of methane produced per head of cattle show that global livestock emissions in 2011 were 11% higher than estimates based on data from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC). Periodic reports by the IPCC, drawing from thousands of scientists, help leaders take action on climate change, which has begun to wreak havoc on weather around the world. “In many regions, livestock numbers are changing, and breeding has resulted in larger animals with higher intakes of food,” said Julie Wolf, a researcher in the US Department of Agriculture and the lead author of a study in the journal Carbon Balance and Management. “This, along with changes in livestock management, can lead to higher methane emissions,” she said. Earlier estimates, Wolf added in a statement, were based on “out-of-date data”. After rising slowly from 2000 to 2006, the concentration of methane in the air has climbed 10 times more quickly in the last decade, according to earlier research. Besides natural sources such as peatland, wetlands and termites, methane from human activity – approximately two-thirds of the total – is produced in two ways: the odourless and colourless gas leaks during the production and transport of coal, oil and especially natural gas; and, in roughly equal measure, from the flatulence of ruminants such as cattle and sheep, as well as the decay of organic waste, notably in landfills. Methane accounted for about 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2015, according to the IPCC. Carbon dioxide – produced mainly by the burning of fossil fuels – accounts for more than three-quarters of planet-warming emissions. “As our diets become more meat- and dairy-rich, so the hidden climate cost of our food tends to mount up,” said profDave Reay from the University of Edinburgh reacting to the study. “Cows belching less methane may not be as eye-catching as wind turbines and solar panels, but they are just as vital for addressing climate change.” The new study boosts the “estimate of human-induced emissions of methane from all sources by about four %,” said prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds , who was not involved in the research. Methane is far more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas, capturing more of the sun’s radiative force, but it persists for less time in the atmosphere. Taking that into account, scientists calculate that over a 100-year period the “global-warming potential” of the gas is 28 times greater than for carbon dioxide. The study noted that methane emissions from livestock have risen most sharply in the rapidly developing regions of Asia, Latin America and Africa. By contrast, the increase has slowed sharply in the US and Canada. In Europe, emissions of the gas have declined. A sharp rise in methane pollution could jeopardise the goal – enshrined in the 196-nation Paris climate pact – of capping global warming below 2C, a consortium of 81 scientists warned in December. “Such a target will become increasingly difficult if reductions in methane emissions are not also addressed strongly and rapidly,” they wrote in an open letter.\n",

Designed in partnership with Stephen Lamb, founder of South Africa based green design firm Touching the Earth Lightly, the Solar Revolution Pavilion is a 200 sq metre, 6-metre high structure built of 1,600 plastic vegetable crates containing reused plastic bottles.. The crates will eventually become eco-friendly bricks for a school library's walls.. The environmentalist David de Rothschild who journeyed across the Pacific on a boat made from plastic bottles in 2010, said at the building's unveiling in Manila's Luneta Park: \"This is a living example of how you can take food, shelter, water and energy using existing resources that people often disregard as wasteful and actually turn them into something that is useful, and beneficial and can create a quality of life.\" The Filipino social entrepreneur Ilac Diaz who helped open the building and whose My Shelter Foundation's \"Liter of Light\" project has transformed plastic bottles into sunlight-powered bulbs for 120,000 homes of the 20 million Filipinos still living without electricity, said the pavilion will also see the launch of a new solar night light. Made by adding LED lights and batteries to the bottles, these lights will be distributed to 150 locations around the country. Visitors to the building will also be able to learn about other locally available green technologies, such as hydroponics, which involves growing plants without soil. Diaz said: \"The point is to teach people how to do it. The world has been too much about expensive technologies that are imported and brought in off-the-shelf. We want people to be able to come out of that pavilion knowing how to build these technologies themselves.\"\n",

      "Text: The planet is facing a “ghastly future of mass extinction, declining health and climate-disruption upheavals” that threaten human survival because of ignorance and inaction, according to an international group of scientists, who warn people still haven’t grasped the urgency of the biodiversity and climate crises. The 17 experts, including Prof Paul Ehrlich from Stanford University, author of The Population Bomb, and scientists from Mexico, Australia and the US, say the planet is in a much worse state than most people – even scientists – understood. “The scale of the threats to the biosphere and all its lifeforms – including humanity – is in fact so great that it is difficult to grasp for even well-informed experts,” they write in a report in Frontiers in Conservation Science which references more than 150 studies detailing the world’s major environmental challenges. The delay between destruction of the natural world and the impacts of these actions means people do not recognise how vast the problem is, the paper argues. “[The] mainstream is having difficulty grasping the magnitude of this loss, despite the steady erosion of the fabric of human civilisation.” The report warns that climate-induced mass migrations, more pandemics and conflicts over resources will be inevitable unless urgent action is taken. “Ours is not a call to surrender – we aim to provide leaders with a realistic ‘cold shower’ of the state of the planet that is essential for planning to avoid a ghastly future,” it adds. Dealing with the enormity of the problem requires far-reaching changes to global capitalism, education and equality, the paper says. These include abolishing the idea of perpetual economic growth, properly pricing environmental externalities, stopping the use of fossil fuels, reining in corporate lobbying, and empowering women, the researchers argue. The report comes months after the world failed to meet a single UN Aichi biodiversity target, created to stem the destruction of the natural world, the second consecutive time governments have failed to meet their 10-year biodiversity goals. This week a coalition of more than 50 countries pledged to protect almost a third of the planet by 2030. An estimated one million species are at risk of extinction, many within decades, according to a recent UN report. “Environmental deterioration is infinitely more threatening to civilisation than Trumpism or Covid-19,” Ehrlich told the Guardian. In The Population Bomb, published in 1968, Ehrlich warned of imminent population explosion and hundreds of millions of people starving to death. Although he has acknowledged some timings were wrong, he has said he stands by its fundamental message that population growth and high levels of consumption by wealthy nations is driving destruction. He told the Guardian: “Growthmania is the fatal disease of civilisation - it must be replaced by campaigns that make equity and well-being society’s goals - not consuming more junk.” Large populations and their continued growth drive soil degradation and biodiversity loss, the new paper warns. “More people means that more synthetic compounds and dangerous throwaway plastics are manufactured, many of which add to the growing toxification of the Earth. It also increases the chances of pandemics that fuel ever-more desperate hunts for scarce resources.” The effects of the climate emergency are more evident than biodiversity loss, but still, society is failing to cut emissions, the paper argues. If people understood the magnitude of the crises, changes in politics and policies could match the gravity of the threat. “Our main point is that once you realise the scale and imminence of the problem, it becomes clear that we need much more than individual actions like using less plastic, eating less meat, or flying less. Our point is that we need big systematic changes and fast,” Professor Daniel Blumstein from the University of California Los Angeles, who helped write the paper, told the Guardian. The paper cites a number of key reports published in the past few years including: The World Economic Forum report in 2020, which named biodiversity loss as one of the top threats to the global economy. The 2019 IPBES Global Assessment report which said 70% of the planet had been altered by humans. The 2020 WWF Living Planet report, which said the average population size of vertebrates had declined by 68% in the past five decades. A 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report which said that humanity had already exceeded global warming of 1C above pre-industrial levels and is set to reach 1.5C warming between 2030 and 2052. The report follows years of stark warnings about the state of the planet from the world’s leading scientists, including a statement by 11,000 scientists in 2019 that people will face “untold suffering due to the climate crisis” unless major changes are made. In 2016, more than 150 of Australia’s climate scientists wrote an open letter to the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, demanding immediate action on reducing emissions. In the same year, 375 scientists – including 30 Nobel prize winners – wrote an open letter to the world about their frustrations over political inaction on climate change. Prof Tom Oliver, an ecologist at the University of Reading, who was not involved in the report, said it was a frightening but credible summary of the grave threats society faces under a “business as usual” scenario. “Scientists now need to go beyond simply documenting environmental decline, and instead find the most effective ways to catalyse action,” he said. Prof Rob Brooker, head of ecological sciences at the James Hutton Institute, who was not involved in the study, said it clearly emphasised the pressing nature of the challenges. “We certainly should not be in any doubt about the huge scale of the challenges we are facing and the changes we will need to make to deal with them,” he said.

      "Text: If there had been a popularity contest at Cop26, the Costa Rican president, Carlos Alvarado Quesada, would have been a clear winner. Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeff Bezos, Boris Johnson and Prince William all wanted to speak with the leader of the tiny Central American country, eager to bask in its green glow. The climate summit in Glasgow was, in effect, Costa Rica’s Super Bowl, another chance to show off its impressive environmental credentials. It is the only tropical country that has successfully halted and reversed deforestation, a commitment dozens of others made at Cop26 but are far from achieving. Costa Rica, which celebrated its bicentenary in 2021, is aiming for total decarbonisation by 2050 – not just a net zero target – and is helping lead the world on efforts to protect 30% of the Earth by the end of this decade. From Christiana Figueres, who was head of the UN climate convention that achieved the Paris agreement in 2015, to Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, chief executive of the Global Environment Facility, Costa Ricans are routinely found in international leadership positions on the environment. Alvarado was proud of Costa Rica’s record when he spoke with the Guardian in early 2021. But in his final interview at Cop26, after an exhausting schedule, Alvarado cautioned that his country’s example should not be taken as a blueprint for others to follow. “The Costa Rican example ought not to be taken literally. Take whatever is good that we have, but also adapt it locally. The thing about our example is the possibility of change and not the particular change itself,” he said. “We have seen the world make global decisions in Glasgow but we cannot be tempted by the idea that they can be a one size fits all solution.” In October, Costa Rica was among the five inaugural Earthshot prize winners for its policy to pay citizens to protect standing forest and restore ecosystems. The scheme is credited with helping reverse one of the worst deforestation rates in the world at the time by altering the cost of clearing trees for coffee, banana and pineapple plantations, recognising that forests are worth more alive than dead. The policy has led to an ecotourism boom. But Alvarado, who is coming to the end of his term as president, does not want to stop there. He acknowledges Costa Rica is “green – but not blue”, prompting the announcement at Cop26 of his country’s involvement in a vast new marine-protected area. “The more we provide an example, the more moral and political leverage there is for others to follow. That’s our approach,” he says. In Glasgow, Denmark and Costa Rica launched the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (Boga) to speed up the end of the fossil fuel industry, attracting intense media attention. While the initiative was set up by a small group of countries that had already committed to phasing out fossil fuels, it is hoped a coalition of the willing can translate into global change. Andrea Meza, Costa Rica’s environment minister who helped announce Boga, says winning the Earthshot prize was a moment of national unity akin to winning a football match. She underscores the importance of combining the inherent value of nature with financial realities to ensure its protection, along with environmental education for all citizens. “What we have learned from the Costa Rican case is that you need to put nature in as part of your development model. It’s not about development and protecting nature. It’s understanding that nature needs to be part of the kind of development that you want. We understood that,” she says. “After one or two generations, you’ll see the change. We can see the different species: the sloth, the hummingbird … and we feel proud.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features  This article was amended on 22 December 2021 to correct the surname of President Alvarado.\n",

      "Text: Cows in the UK could be given “methane blockers” to reduce their emissions of the greenhouse gas as part of plans to achieve the country’s climate goals. Farmers welcomed the proposal, which follows a consultation that began in August on how new types of animal feed product can reduce digestive emissions from the animals. However, green campaigners were sceptical, arguing that the move would not address the other major environmental harms resulting from the beef and dairy industries and showed a fixation on “techno fixes” rather than reducing consumption. There are about 9.4m cows and calves in the UK. Methane from cattle burps and manure is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions; globally, cows and other farm animals are responsible for about 14% of human-induced climate emissions. The government said in its net zero growth strategy published last week that it expected “high-efficacy methane-suppressing products” to enter the market from 2025 and could force farmers to use them if they prove effective. It said: “We … will explore the role of industry and government to maximise uptake of such products for suitable cattle farm systems at pace, through a phased approach. “This will include the ambition to mandate the introduction of products with proven safety and efficacy in compound feeds for cattle as soon as practically possible in England.” Tom Bradshaw, deputy president of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU), said most of the methane emitted by cows is released by belching, “the front end rather than the back end”. “The evidence suggests these products could be useful,” he said. “I don’t think we know enough yet about the impact they will have on the efficiency of the diet … but it’s something that we have to investigate to try and reduce methane emissions.” Methane-suppressing products are being trialled in the UK, he said, but have yet to yield evidence as to what extent they work. The government has been criticised for a reliance on unproven technologies to pursue its climate goals. One group of 700 scientists criticised last week’s net zero strategy for its emphasis on carbon capture and storage, which they said was “yet to be proved at scale”. Vicki Hird, head of farming for Sustain, an alliance of organisations that promote better food and farming, was similarly sceptical of the methane blocker plan. “Governments and industry love their techno fixes like cattle feed methane suppressants and these may help a bit. “But they won’t fix the major harms associated with our huge livestock fixation, from rainforest clearance for feeds and pasture to UK river pollution and harm to wildlife, all of which inhibit action on climate, too. We need to produce and eat less and better meat using agro-ecological tools known for whole farm and nature benefits.” The Food Standards Agency is responsible for licensing all animal feeds and would have to carry out a robust risk assessments of the impacts of each additive on animal health and welfare, food safety risks, risk to workers, wider environmental risks, and of the efficacy of the products, before licensing them for use in feed to reduce methane, according to the NFU. At the moment, there are no additives licensed and available for use in the UK that suppress methane. However, applications have been submitted while the trials are conducted. Bradshaw also pointed to genetic advances, namely breeding cows and sheep that emit less methane. Some countries, such as New Zealand, say they have reduced methane emissions from cattle through genetics. A government spokesperson said: “Well-managed livestock can provide various environmental benefits and we plan to encourage the uptake of high-efficacy methane-suppressing products once they reach the UK market.” The government is yet to publish its response to the consultation of the farming industry, scientists and the public on cattle feed.  This article was amended on 3 April 2023 because an earlier version suggested that cows in the UK produce 14% of human-related emissions; that figure relates to emissions by cows and other farm animals across the globe.\n",

      "Text: The Morrison government’s emissions reduction fund – rebadged as a “climate solutions” policy and to be boosted with an extra $2bn – is being used to help one of the world’s biggest gold miners pay for a fossil fuel power plant the company concedes it would have built anyway. Fund opponents say it is the latest evidence that design flaws in the scheme are leading to taxpayers’ money being wasted on projects that are commercially viable even without public support. In some cases, the climate funding is going to new fossil fuel projects on the grounds that they are cleaner than the dirty projects they replace. National greenhouse gas emissions have risen each year since the fund, billed by the then-prime minister Tony Abbott as a “direct action” policy, replaced a carbon pricing scheme in 2014. South African mining company Gold Fields is receiving climate funding for a gas-fired station to power the underground Granny Smith mine in outback Western Australia. According to its annual reports, it has received $126,000 and expects to get about $1m over seven years. Gold Fields built the gas plant to replace a diesel-fired generator after it was announced a new gas pipeline would be laid to supply the nearby Tropicana mine. It qualified for the emissions reduction fund because burning gas emits less carbon dioxide than diesel. To qualify to bid into the emissions reduction fund, projects are meant to deliver emissions cuts that would not have happened without public money. But a Gold Fields spokesman told Guardian Australia that it would have built the gas plant regardless of support from the fund. “The investment would have been made, but at the time there was a risk that gas prices could have risen in the future, like we have seen recently on the east coast of Australia. When the investment decision was made, the [fund] was considered a partial mitigation against future price escalation,” the spokesman said. Kelly O’Shanassy, the chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, which has been investigating the fund’s operation, said it was beyond parody that public money earmarked to cut emissions had been handed to a giant gold miner to burn gas for a project it would have built anyway. She said the project may add to damage to the climate by locking the miner into gas ahead of a more rapid shift to renewable energy. Gold Fields recently announced it would be installing solar power and batteries at the mine site to use alongside gas. “Australians should rightly ask whether allocating more money to the emissions reduction fund at this time will mean more cash for big industrial players to burn coal, oil and gas,” O’Shanassy said. “A program like the emissions reduction fund has a role to encourage farmers and landowners to cut pollution, plant more trees and protect vegetation, but methods that pay large corporations to make at best minor changes must be scrapped before any more cash is tipped in.” The $2.55bn fund works as a reverse auction, supporting the projects that promise the cheapest emissions cuts. Payments are made once the cuts are delivered. Across eight auctions, taxpayers have paid out $476m and committed another $1.8bn, with $226m left unspent. On Monday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, promised another $2bn over 10 years to partner with farmers, local governments and businesses to deliver “practical climate solutions” across the economy that reduce emissions. He said the government was committed to “meaningful, practical action” to reduce emissions and would meet its 2030 target of a 26-28% cut in pollution below 2005 levels. Most projections before Monday’s announcement, which also included a commitment to new investments in pumped hydro power and a yet-to-be-released electric vehicle strategy, have found it was not on track to meet the target. “We will continue to play our part in meeting the global challenge of climate change in the 21st century,” Morrison said. Guardian Australia recently reported that the Vales Point coalmine has been registered under the fund for a project to upgrade some turbines, a project that would reduce its emissions by just 1.3% over a decade. It may yet not qualify to bid into the auction as the project will not reduce its emissions intensity below the average of the national grid. But the revelation that a coal plant could qualify for climate funding sparked campaigns from environment groups calling for the scheme to be changed. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated that putting the world on a pathway to limiting global warming to 1.5C and avoiding more significant climate change requires coal use for energy to be cut 59-78% below 2010 levels by 2030. Several problems with the emissions reduction fund have been identified. The bulk of the money has gone to landowners promising to restore or protect carbon stores in vegetation and the land, but across the country deforestation is outpacing habitat restoration by a rate of five to one. It was found landfill sites that capture and burn leaking methane – another regular recipient of contracts under the fund – would have existed without taxpayer support. Many of these problems were predicted. While on the backbench in 2010, Malcolm Turnbull branded the fund “a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale” and let the fund dwindle. Once prime minister, he let the fund dwindle to almost nothing and promoted alternatives such as the national energy guarantee, which was opposed by conservatives and dumped by Morrison once he assumed the leadership. In the case of Gold Fields, the company has announced that it is expanding both the Granny Smith mine and the gas plant as well as installing solar and batteries. It said the shift would cut its gas use by 10–13%, but the gas plant needed to be expanded to meet increased demand for ventilation, cooling and dewatering at night. The company’s spokesman said it would receive large-scale generation certificates through the national renewable energy target for the solar energy it generates, but the projected future value of the certificates was not encouraging for future clean power investment in Australia. Asked if the company thought helping large businesses shift to a cleaner form of fossil fuels was a good use of climate funding, the spokesman said the few off-grid renewable energy mining projects in Australia to date have had some form of government support. “Without government enabling these early adopters, the movement to cleaner energy will take much longer,” he said. But he said Gold Fields was demonstrating it was feasible to invest in large-scale solar without additional support.\n",

      "Text: The New South Wales Independent Planning Commission has approved a coalmine expansion in the state’s Upper Hunter region that would cause almost 1bn tonnes of carbon emissions. The decision will allow MACH Energy to double the output of its Mount Pleasant mine in Muswellbrook to 21m tonnes a year and extend its life to 2048. The Lock the Gate Alliance has slammed the decision as “reckless and irresponsible” and called for a national approach to major projects that factored the climate crisis into assessments. The project would be responsible for 876 megatonnes of emissions over its life, 860 megatonnes of which would be the result of emissions produced after the coal is sold and used, mostly overseas. “It is madness that as humanity teeters on the brink of climate catastrophe, an assessment authority such as the IPC can wave through a coalmine that will be solely responsible for 876m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions,” said Lock the Gate’s NSW coordinator Nic Clyde. “This project is the largest coalmine expansion approved in the state since the Paris agreement called on nations of the world to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees yet is totally inconsistent with that pledge.” The federal environment and water minister, Tanya Plibersek, must still make a decision on whether the project should proceed and the alliance called on the minister to reject it. It comes after the Greens introduced legislation that would create a “climate trigger” in national environmental laws that would ban developments emitting more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon. It would also require federal assessment of developments emitting 25,000 to 100,000 tonnes of carbon. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Wendy Wales, a member of the Denman Aberdeen Muswellbrook Scone Healthy Environment Group, said the expansion was “another nail in the coffin of our local environment” that would contribute to further loss of critically endangered habitats and a corridor used by local threatened wildlife. “If the significant problem of catastrophic climate change were understood by our politicians – state and federal, Labor and Coalition – and the mining companies themselves, this mine would not proceed,” she said. In its decision, the commission said of the 960 public submissions it received, 689 supported the project, 251 objected to it and 20 were considered comments. It said the submissions in support related to the economic aspects of the project and concerns about the effects mine closures would have on communities. Most of the objections related to air quality, emissions and climate change. The commission found the project should be approved subject to strict conditions, saying it “would achieve an appropriate balance between relevant environmental, economic and social considerations”. In its statement of reasons, the commission wrote it received submissions expressing concern about the project’s emissions and the impact it would have on climate change and future generations. But it said under the rules of the Paris agreement the 860 megatonne of scope 3 emissions were “attributed to the country within which they are emitted”. It found the remaining projected emissions were “consistent with the current national and NSW policy settings and commitments”. The commission found the project’s effects on the environment could be minimised or offset. It included a condition that the company demonstrate in its biodiversity management plan how it will avoid or minimise serious or irreversible damage to a newly described legless lizard on the mine site. MACH Energy’s managing director, Ferdian Purnamasidi, said the decision was an important milestone for the Hunter community where structural change was occurring and some mines were closing and winding down. “Today’s decision by the IPC finally provides certainty for local communities and ensures Mount Pleasant can continue to contribute to those local communities and the entire state for many years to come,” he said. He said more than $1 billion of additional capital would be invested in the mine in coming years and local operational job numbers would increase from 380 to 830 at peak production. He said the company acknowledged the “significant conditions” attached to the approval and would “continue to take an evidence-based approach to meeting our responsibilities”.\n",

      "Text: The Dutch parliament has voted for a 55% cut in CO2 emissions by 2030, which would require the closure of all the country’s coal-fired power plants. The unexpected vote on Thursday night by 77 to 72 would bring the Netherlands clearly into line with the Paris climate agreement, with some of the most ambitious climate policies in Europe. It is not binding on the government, but the Liberal and Labour parties say they will now push for speedy implementation of the motion. Five Dutch coal-fired power stations were closed last year but the country still has another five plants in operation. Three of these came online in 2015, and have been blamed for a 5% rise in the country’s emissions last year. The Dutch Liberal MP and vice president of the parliament, Stientje van Veldhoven, told the Guardian: “Closing down big coal plants – even if they were recently opened – is by far the most cost effective way to achieve the goals of the Paris agreement, and all countries will need to take such far-reaching measures. We cannot continue to use coal as the cheapest source of energy when it is the most expensive from a climate perspective.” A court in the Netherlands last year ordered prime minister Mark Rutte’s government to cut its emissions by a quarter by 2020, citing the severity of the global warming threat which the Netherlands has recognised in international treaties. Dennis van Berkel, legal counsel for Urgenda, the group which brought the case, described the vote as “an enormous leap for climate policy in the Netherlands”. The vote also calls for a 25% emissions cut by 2020. The country’s centre-right coalition government is pursuing a twin-track response of appealing the ruling to the country’s higher court, while preparing a climate package for early November. This could include limited coal plant closures, more funding for projects involving renewable energy, carbon capture and storage, and geothermal heating. Some environmentalists fear that the final package will involve a coalition deal that renders the parliamentary vote obsolete. The issue has been a divisive one in the Netherlands, with the Labour party, a coalition partner in Rutte’s government, backing the opposition in yesterday’s vote. The Dutch environment ministry was not immediately available to comment on the vote. However, the economic minister Henk Kamp spoke out earlier this month against any mothballing of the three new plants built by EOn, RWE and Engie. “They are the cleanest (coal plants) in Europe,” he said. “We’d be crazy if we shut them.” In March, the Netherlands will elect a new government, with Geert Wilders’ far-right, populist and anti-immigrant Freedom Party leading many opinion polls. Wilders has previously spoken dismissively of “the sinister green-windmill subsidy complex”. Willem Wiskerke, a spokesman for Greenpeace Netherlands said: “He is a climate denier like Donald Trump, nothing more, nothing less, a rightwing, fact-free populist who denies the climate crisis and will not put any effort into solving it.” While yesterday’s coal-crushing vote is not formally binding, van Veldhoven said she was optimistic that quick action to force a decision this autumn would tip the government’s hand, before next year’s elections. “It is our clear political statement so this is what they must do,” she said. “It is a motion, not a law, so there is some room for manoeuvre. But having one coalition partner support it is always a good guarantee that an adopted motion will be enforced.” Following passage of any new law, EU Emissions Trading System permits would also have to be reduced, to prevent a freak surplus lowering the price of carbon allowances, van Veldhoven said. The parliamentary vote follows a recent report by the consultancy CE Delft, which found that the cheapest way to meet the Netherlands’ climate commitments would be to close one or two new coal stations. The paper, which was commissioned by Eneco, a Dutch green power company, estimated this would cost the average household €30 (£26) a year, but save them €80 a year on energy bills. However, the Dutch government’s economic ministry has tallied the bill for closing all of the country’s coal plants by 2020 at €7bn. While this would have little effect on energy security and cut Holland’s emissions by 31%, the CO2 savings would fall to just 9% due to a rise in coal-produced power imports, the report said.\n",

      "Text: If you reckon the 11 September terrorist attacks might have been an “inside job” or there is a nefarious new world order doing whatever it is the illuminati do, what are you likely to think about the causes of climate change? Academics have suggested that people who tend to accept conspiracy theories also underplay or reject the science showing humans are causing rapid and dangerous climate change. But a new study that tested this idea across 24 different countries found the link between so-called “conspiratorial ideation” and “climate scepticism” only really holds in the US. University of Queensland psychology professor Matthew Hornsey and colleagues surveyed 5,300 people to test the link between climate “scepticism” and acceptance of four internationally propagated conspiracy theories around the assassination of President Kennedy, the 11 September terrorist attacks, the death of Princess Diana and the existence of a new world order.  Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday Only in the US did the correlation fall outside the margin of error. This is perhaps not surprising, given the booming online conspiracy culture in the Trumpocene, with even would-be presidential science advisers hanging around with conspiracy theorists. The study also tried to tease out the links between the rejection of human-caused climate change and the ideologies that people hold. It’s here that the study offers the greatest cause for hope, Hornsey says. He has developed a form of “jiujitsu” persuasion technique that he thinks might work. There’s been a general acceptance that people who have broadly conservative or rightwing ideologies tend to rail against climate science because it rubs their worldview up the wrong way. That is, that tackling climate change will require broad interventions from governments. But Hornsey’s study finds that “there is nothing inherent to conspiratorial ideation or conservative ideologies that predisposes people to reject climate science”. Instead, it suggests vested interests have managed to reshape the conservative identity with “ignorance-building strategies” in two countries – the US and Australia. Hornsey agreed to expand on the study by answering further questions by email. You found that in the US people’s climate “scepticism” was more aligned to a conservative worldview than any other country surveyed. Why do you think the US is in this position? What role do the views of high-profile politicians have in influencing voters to think about the issue in a certain way? Why do you think this has happened? In the paper, you say “there is nothing inherent to conspiratorial ideation or conservative ideologies that predisposes people to reject climate science”. Can you clarify this? Doesn’t endorsement of small governments and low regulation actually predispose conservatives to engage in motivated reasoning to reject the science of climate change? What do you think it would take for the US and Australia to break the apparent link between conservative ideology and climate “scepticism”?\n",

      "Text: Last week the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for an end to new coal-fired power plants. Many European countries including the UK and Germany are decreasing their dependence on coal, but this is not the case everywhere. Across Africa many people rely on standby diesel generators to supplement erratic electricity supplies, leading to local air pollution problems and high emissions of climate-heating carbon dioxide. Although Africa is in a unique position to leapfrog dependence on fossil fuels and utilise abundant renewable sources such as wind and solar, the continent is embarking on a massive expansion of fossil fuel electricity. More than 200 new power stations are planned, the majority of which will burn coal. Power ships – vast floating power stations, some burning highly polluting bunker oil – are already moored in Ghana, Sierra Leone and Mozambique. African countries have little air quality legislation and poor enforcement. Without emission controls, a study led by the University of Leicester found, the air pollution from these new power plants and expanded fossil fuel use in transport could lead to an avoidable 48,000 early deaths each year by 2030. These are predicted to be mostly in South Africa, Malawi and Nigeria, where oil industry flares are already a major pollution source.\n",

      "Text: Germany’s Allianz SE, one of the world’s largest financial asset managers, said on Tuesday it would decrease investments in companies using coal and boost funding in those focused on wind power over the next six months. Chief executive Oliver Baete said Allianz will no longer invest in companies if more than 30% percent of sales come from coal mining or if coal generates more than 30% percent of electricity. He said Allianz decided ahead of next week’s United Nations climate change conference in France with “an eye on the 2C goal of the Paris climate negotiations as well as the economic risks involved.” In 2014, Allianz managed about €1.8tn ($1.9tn) assets in US, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and the Asia-Pacific region. The company plans to release more details later in the week, but experts estimate the decision on coal would affect investments worth €4bn. Some 90% of the investments affected are in bonds that will be allowed to mature while the six-month frame will apply to equities, Allianz said. In Paris, more than 190 countries are to negotiate a new global pact to fight climate change. Most of them have already presented plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions after 2020, when the deal is supposed to take effect. Environmental activist group 350.org applauded Allianz’s decision: “As the world’s largest insurance company, Allianz knows a thing or two about risk – and there’s no greater risk for the climate than continuing to invest in an industry that is wrecking the planet.” The group said the company’s decision, and that of others, to divest from coal will weaken the fossil fuel industry’s political influence. “Decisions of large investors like Allianz, however, also hit the industry’s financial stability. It sends a clear signal to investors that the world is rapidly moving away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy.” Allianz investment chief Andreas Gruber told ZDF television that the company’s decision was based on concern over global warming, but also because it made good financial sense. He said the company is convinced climate-damaging investments won’t pay off in the future and said Allianz will double wind energy investments to €4bn. It expects a return of 5-6%. “We want to support the negotiations at the climate summit in Paris in December, but also send a signal to our industry and the capital markets,” Gruber said.\n",

      "Text: The letter on Wednesday (Clearer green energy targets are needed, 28 August) was quite right in recognising the UK’s lofty ambitions to become one of the cleanest and most innovative energy systems in the world on our path to becoming a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. But I take issue with the suggestion that our ambitions are not matched by our actions. We’re investing £274m to develop cheap, high-performance and durable batteries. We’re removing regulatory barriers to allow more storage facilities across the UK. We’re supporting small-scale localised energy generation through our smart export guarantee – continuing our world-leading support for the solar industry. As members of the EU, we were obliged to implement the VAT increase for solar technology and storage. Once we leave, it may be possible to review this. All of this is supported by upgrades to the country’s energy infrastructure through our smart meter rollout and smart systems and flexibility plan. This enables homeowners to save money by putting them in control of their energy use, such as by charging electric vehicles or storing energy in a battery when it is cheapest. As well as revolutionising how our energy is generated, transported and stored, the plan is ensuring our readiness for the growth of clean energy. Last year, low-carbon sources provided more than half our electricity and this is certain to grow as we allow renewables into the capacity market and end our reliance on coal by 2025. There is a £40bn prize for the taking; we have a plan and we’re acting on it.Ian DuncanMinister for climate change, Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy  Judge Richard Blake misses the point when he tells the Extinction Rebellion activists arrested for public order offences that “legitimate protests do not need to break the law” (Report, 23 August). Where has 30 years of “legitimate” protesting got us? Extinction Rebellion disruption pales into insignificance when seen in the context of the climate and social disruption that is coming down the road. History has shown peaceful civil disobedience and personal sacrifice to be (perhaps the only) effective tools to bring about system change. Which is why I and thousands of other are preparing for rebellion in October. If we do nothing we stand to lose everything anyway, so what’s to fear?Carol BlumenthalAndover, Hampshire  I worked in Texas for a year in 1969. Expecting the weather to be hot, I was amazed to find I was frozen in air conditioning in buildings and homes (Blowing cold and hot , 29 August). I used to walk outside every hour to heat up until I earned enough money to buy a warm cardigan. I was delighted when the air conditioning broke down for a week and temperatures returned to what I regarded as comfortable. In the present English record-breaking temperatures I manage to keep my house comfortable by judicious use of indoor and outdoor blinds and opening and closing windows according to the outside temperature. It would be even better if installers of European shutters were more available here. Air conditioning adding to more global warming is not a good solution.Wendy MulvilleMaldon, Essex  I look forward to reading Steve Edwards’s post-apocalyptic novel when it appears (Letters, 29 August). But he should be aware that in 500 years there will be no human communities – small, scientific, scholarly or otherwise – to consider what happened in the 21st century. The ecosystem required to support a complex species such as ours will have been eliminated by the biodiversity crash, insectageddon, the climate crisis, and the mass release of global warming gases from dying forests, Arctic permafrosts and the deep oceans. In 500 years from now, the crumbling remains of our cities and towns will be ruled by cockroaches and rats, who of course have no capacity to investigate the catastrophe that rendered us extinct.Joseph NicholasTottenham, London  Regarding the furore about Brazil’s Amazon forest fires, I would like to point out that all built-up areas across the world were once mostly forested, and were cleared for homes and farming. Britain, the US, Canada, New Zealand, Russia, Australia, South Africa and others have all cut down millions of acres of forested areas over several hundred years. We call the Amazon the “lungs of the world”. But let’s not forget that most of the other lungs of the world we have already destroyed. When Europeans arrived in North America it was impossible to travel without entering forests. Let’s not forget our past contribution to climate change.Michael CookPoole, Dorset  Seven years ago, Britain hosted an Olympic Games that had set out to “inspire a generation”. And it delivered. The baton was duly passed to Brazil in 2016, who called for um novo mundo, a new world. Yet now Brazil’s government backs the destruction of rainforests. Our leaders seem unwilling to respond to the science. The Arctic melts, oceans acidify and wildfires rage, all as never before. That “new world” – our world – faces an existential threat, the climate and ecological crises. Thankfully, the 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg asks: “Where are the adults?” We sporting champions hear your call, Greta. Your courage and clarity have inspired us, and called us into the arena. Sport brings communities together across the globe and teaches us how to dream big, make sacrifices, push beyond perceived limits, and rise to the occasion. We now mobilise these qualities in support of Earth – alongside all young people fighting not just for their own future, but that of all life. While acknowledging that we and our sports must continue to reduce our environmental impact, we are stepping up in the spirit of fair play, teamwork and empowerment. And we call on other athletes and “everyday champions” to step up too, for in these times every person has the power to lead. Let us all unite as “Champions for Earth”, standing with young people all across the world for the global climate strike on 20 September.

      "Text: Today we focus our concern on climate change, but 40 years ago it was acid rain and forest die-back that dominated our air and environment debate. In 1977, a new measurement programme showed that the sulphur landing in Scandinavia was far greater than the countries were producing. Industrial coal burning and westerly winds meant that the UK was Europe’s largest exporter of sulphur air pollution. Moving power generation to the countryside and building tall chimneys had reduced local air pollution but did not prevent sulphur being transported over thousands of kilometres. This was at the height of the cold war. Warsaw Pact countries offered 30% reductions in their sulphur emissions and watched as the western allies were split. The UK was isolated and Canadian provinces were pitched against upwind industrial states in the US. Redolent of climate change denial today, UK scientists and civil servants placed emphasis on the uncertainties rather than on what was known; they trivialised forest damage and the impacts of fish dying in acidified rivers. A Nature editorial suggested that the UK could offer crushed limestone to be sprinkled in Norwegian rivers and that the Norwegians would be foolish if they did not accept. Other articles attacked the concept that industry in one country should take responsibility for damage in another. Finally the Thatcher government conceded. The resultant agreements and the 1999 Gothenburg Protocol still play a central role in curbing our air pollution. The human health implications were not sufficiently understood in the 1970s and 1980s, but the resulting reductions are estimated to prevent around 80,000 premature deaths each year in the EU – an annual gain of around $250bn (£184bn), or 1.4% of EU GDP.\n",

      "Text: The boom in the US shale gas and oil may have ignited a significant global spike in methane emissions blamed for accelerating the pace of the climate crisis, according to research. Scientists at Cornell University have found the “chemical fingerprints” of the rising global methane levels point to shale oil and shale gas as the probable source. Methane, levels of which have been increasing sharply since 2008, is a potent greenhouse gas that heats the atmosphere quicker than carbon dioxide. Researchers at Cornell said the carbon composition of atmospheric methane, or the “weight” of carbon within each methane molecule, was changing too. Robert Howarth, the author of the paper published in the journal Biogeosciences, said the proportion of methane with a “carbon signature” linked to traditional fossil fuels was falling relative to the rise of methane with a slightly different carbon make-up. Researchers had previously assumed the “non-traditional” methane was from biological sources such as cows and wetlands, but the latest research suggests unconventional oil and gas from fracking may be playing a significant part. The theory would support a correlation in the rise of methane in the atmosphere and the boom in fracking across the US over the last decade. “This recent increase in methane is massive,” Howarth said. “It’s globally significant. It’s contributed to some of the increase in global warming we’ve seen and shale gas is a major player.” However, UK academics have said the jury is still out because there remained “significant uncertainty” about the theory, which has not been conclusively proven. The claim is “highly contentious in the academic community and further work is needed to constrain uncertainty before conclusions such as this can be robustly backed up”, said Prof Grant Allen, from the Centre for Atmospheric Science at the University of Manchester. “However, this paper makes a very important point,” he said. “Controlling emissions from fracking, and fossil fuels in general, represents a potential policy quick fix to stemming the rise of methane still further.” Howarth said his report showed that if humans stopped emitting large quantities of methane into the atmosphere, it would dissipate. “It goes away pretty quickly, compared to carbon dioxide. It’s the low-hanging fruit to slow global warming,” he said.\n",

      "Text: One of the most southerly populations of polar bears now has only limited time to hunt on sea ice due to a warming climate, research suggests. The polar bears of Hudson Bay, Canada, migrate onto land in the summer when the sea ice melts, relying on fat reserves to survive until the sea refreezes in late November or early December. During the winter and spring months they take to the sea ice to hunt their prey of seals. But the bears have been coming to land earlier and leaving later in recent years as a result of climate change reducing the ice, said researchers from the British Ecological Society in the Journal of Animal Ecology. Longer stretches without food were impacting the predators' health, breeding success and population, as for polar bears, \"it's survival of the fattest\", the researchers said. The research involved monitoring 109 female polar bears between 1991 and 1997 and between 2004 and 2009, using radio collars which cannot be fitted to male bears as their necks are wider than their heads and the devices would fall off. The team, led by Dr Seth Cherry, of the University of Alberta, Canada, also monitored the position and concentration of sea ice using satellite images. The migration patterns of the bears were governed by the conditions of the sea ice, and climate-induced changes to the rate and timing of sea ice melt and refreezing affected how long the bears spent on land, the study said. Tracking the bears revealed a trend of them arriving onshore earlier in the spring and departing later in the autumn. Previous studies have shown that the western Hudson Bay polar bear population, recently estimated at about 900 animals, has declined since the 1990s, as have their body condition and the number of cubs surviving to adulthood. Cherry said: \"The data suggest that in recent years, polar bears are arriving on shore earlier in the summer and leaving later in the autumn. \"These are precisely the kind of changes one would expect to see as a result of a warming climate and may help explain some other studies that are showing declines in body condition and cub production.\" The longer the bears spend on land, the longer they have to go without their energy-rich seal food, with consequent impacts on their health and survival. \"Climate-induced changes that cause sea ice to melt earlier, form later, or both, likely affect the overall health of polar bears in the area.\"\n",

      "Text: Indoor levels of carbon dioxide could be clouding our thinking and may even pose a wider danger to human health, researchers say. While air pollutants such as tiny particles and nitrogen oxides have been the subject of much research, there have been far fewer studies looking into the health impact of CO2. However, the authors of the latest study – which reviews current evidence on the issue – say there is a growing body of research suggesting levels of CO2 that can be found in bedrooms, classrooms and offices might have harmful effects on the body, including affecting cognitive performance. “There is enough evidence to be concerned, not enough to be alarmed. But there is no time to waste,” said Dr Michael Hernke, a co-author of the study from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, stressing further research was needed. Writing in the journal Nature Sustainability, Hernke and colleagues report that they considered 18 studies of the levels of CO2 humans are exposed to, as well as its health impacts on both humans and animals. Traditionally, the team say, it had been thought that CO2 levels would need to reach a very high concentration of at least 5,000 parts per million (ppm) before they would affect human health. But a growing body of research suggests CO2 levels as low as 1,000ppm could cause health problems, even if exposure only lasts for a few hours. The team say crowded or poorly ventilated classrooms, office environments and bedrooms have all been found to have levels of CO2 that exceed 1,000ppm, and are spaces that people often remain in for many hours at a time. Air-conditioned trains and planes have also been found to exceed 1,000ppm. “Indoor environments are of much more concern presently and for many people that is where they spend 60-80% of their time,” said Hernke, although projections suggest by 2100 some large cities might reach outdoor CO2 levels of 1,000ppm for parts of the year. The team found a number of studies have looked at the impact of such levels on human cognitive performance and productivity. In one study of 24 employees, cognitive scores were 50% lower when the participants were exposed to 1,400ppm of CO2 compared with 550ppm during a working day. The team additionally looked at the impact of CO2 levels on animals, finding that a few hours’ exposure to 2,000 ppm was linked to inflammatory responses that could lead to damage to blood vessels. There is also tentative evidence suggesting that prolonged exposure to levels between 2,000 and 3,000ppm is linked to effects including stress, kidney calcification and bone demineralisation. The team add that rising outdoor levels of CO2 will mean rising indoor levels – a situation that could be exacerbated by greater use of certain air-conditioning units, people spending more time inside, energy-saving building techniques, and increasing urbanisation. Any health impacts, they add, might be particularly problematic for children or those with health conditions that might exacerbate the effects. And even if the impacts are reversible, said Hernke, it would depend on people being able to access air with low levels of CO2. “The question is what happens over the very long term when you are unable to go outside and, as it were, have that carbon sucked back out of you?” Dr Gary Fuller, an air pollution scientist at King’s College London, said his team had been measuring CO2 levels in London for the past decade. While levels rarely reached 1,000ppm, he said, they often exceeded 750ppm along busy roads. “Unless we decarbonise heating and transport then these peaks will worsen as the global background increases,” he said.\n",

      "Text: There is much about this government’s – and, to its shame, Labour’s – newfound love affair with nuclear power that makes no sense (Johnson announces aim for UK to get 25% of electricity from nuclear power, 21 March). First, you cannot just turn off a nuclear power station. If we have 25% of our electricity generated by nuclear, then on days when all our needs can be met by renewables we will have to turn off 25% of our much cheaper renewable feed while using expensive, taxpayer-subsidised nuclear generation. Second, we have no way of dealing with the mountains of dangerous high-level and intermediate-level waste that has been accruing since the 1950s. To generate more is sheer madness. Third, nuclear power stations are vulnerable to the elements and to hostile attack – cyber, terrorist, state actors etc. Recent events in the Ukraine make this very real. Fourth, the old argument about what we do when the wind isn’t blowing and the skies are overcast over the whole of the UK, which doesn’t stand up to much scrutiny now, falls away completely if we were to invest just a small amount of the taxpayer money that will go to the nuclear industry into research and development of electricity storage. Finally, given the nuclear industry’s track record of bringing in plants well over budget, decades late, the proposed programme is not going to be realised until 2060 at the earliest. Why on earth are we contemplating it?John FrenchBrockweir, Gloucestershire  Your report states that “electricity demand is expected to rise steadily in the next decade”. The same justification was used in 2006, when the Labour government first committed to further nuclear power stations. Based on the official forecasts issued in 2006, we should by now be consuming at least 15% more electricity than we were then. But we are not. UK electricity consumption has in practice gone down by more than 15% since 2006. In the interim, no new nuclear power stations have been added to the system. It hasn’t collapsed, and is far less carbon-intensive. Surely we aren’t getting fooled again by the same spurious rhetoric about endless consumption growth? In that immortal phrase of the 1970s: “Save it. You know it makes sense.”Andrew WarrenChairman, British Energy Efficiency Federation  The dash to fossil fuels is not the environmental disaster set out by António Guterres (Ukraine war threatens global heating goals, warns UN chief, 21 March). It is, at worst, the replacement of existing hydrocarbons purchased from Russia. In the longer term, it is clear that alternative renewable energy sources will displace fossil fuels and most countries will wish to do this as quickly as possible. The government’s desire, supported by Labour, for increased nuclear power generation is bizarre. A wind turbine capable of producing 15MW can be installed offshore for £10m. Sizewell C is expected to cost £20bn and produce 3.2GW of electricity – this does not include decommissioning costs. To generate 3.2GW would need 214 turbines costing £3.2bn, albeit some money would need to be spent on storage capacity. The government plans to invest £1.7bn in Sizewell C.

      "Text: America's carbon dioxide emissions last year fell to their lowest levels since 1994, according to a new report. Carbon dioxide emissions fell by 13% in the past five years, because of new energy-saving technologies and a doubling in the take-up of renewable energy, the report compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) for the Business Council for Sustainable Energy (BCSE) said. The reduction in climate pollution – even as Congress failed to act on climate change – brings America more than halfway towards Barack Obama's target of cutting emissions by 17% from 2005 levels over the next decade, the Bloomberg analysts said. By the end of last year, America's emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions had fallen 10.7% from the 2005 baselines. That drop puts Obama in a better position to defend his environmental achievements, which have often gone overlooked in the bitter rows over climate science. It may also buoy up America's standing in the global climate negotiations. \"There have certainly been some solid results on the board in the US as a result of all these changes,\" Ethan Zindler, a BNEF analyst said. A report last year by the independent thinktank Resources for the Future also suggested America was on course to meet those targets. Lisa Jacobson, president of the BCSE, said the Bloomberg findings exposed the conservative argument that acting on climate change would be a drag on the economy. Instead, carbon emissions declined even as GDP was going up, she noted. As described by Bloomberg, the US is in the throes of a major shift in energy production. Coal fell to just 18.1% of America's energy mix last year, down from 22.5% in 2007. Oil use also declined. The explosion of natural gas production, thanks to fracking, filled much of the gap. America got 31% of its electricity from gas-fired power plants last year. But the report found steadily expanding installation of wind, solar, hydro and geothermal energy. Renewables represented the largest single source of new growth last year, reaching $44bn in 2012, the report said, the report said. Over the same time span, total energy use fell since 2007, by 6.4%, the report said. Most of the emissions cuts were due to installing more efficient heating and cooling systems in commercial building. Other cuts in emission came from transport, with 488,000 Americans last year opting for hybrid and plug-in vehicles.\n",

      "Text: Australia’s role as a leader in the global fossil fuel trade is underscored by a report that finds it is the world’s third biggest exporter and fifth biggest miner of fossil-related emissions. While political debate sometimes emphasises that Australia is responsible for 1.2% of global emissions at home, the analysis by progressive thinktank the Australia Institute says it trails only Russia and Saudi Arabia in exporting fossil fuels. When exports and what is burned at home are combined, Australia ranks fifth behind China, the US, Russia and Saudi Arabia in responsibility for carbon dioxide from extractive fossil industries. The premise of the report – that Australia plays a greater role in the climate crisis than global greenhouse accounting rules suggest – is not new, but it goes further than some previous analyses in comparing exports emissions from different countries. Its release follows the prime minister, Scott Morrison, facing criticism at the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu over Australia’s limited response to the climate crisis and refusal to commit to a rapid transition away from coal. The government and opposition both stress the importance of the coal export industry to the economy and employment. The institute’s report, by the senior researcher Tom Swann, challenges this, finding Australia’s economy is more diverse and less reliant on fossil fuels than that of most carbon exporters. It says Australia ranks 24th for carbon intensity across all exports, reflecting the broad range of goods it trades in. Australia is responsible for 7% of global fossil fuel exports based on their carbon dioxide potential. Its coal exports doubled between 2000 and 2015 and now make up 29% of the global coal trade. Liquefied natural gas exports tripled over the same timeframe to 6% of trade, and continue to increase. The report says exports are often downplayed in climate change policy as treaties focus on demand for carbon-intensive products rather than supply. This ignores that increasing supply and supply infrastructure can “lock in” emissions increases. “The scale of exports from countries like Australia bring into stark relief why efforts to reduce emissions must limit both demand and supply,” it says. In terms of domestic emissions, the report says Australia is the 14th biggest emitter despite having just 0.3% of the global population. It emits more greenhouse gas than 40 countries with bigger populations. While the government promises to cut carbon dioxide, national emissions have increased year-on-year since the abolition of a carbon price scheme in 2014. As a member of the Pacific Islands Forum, Australia last week backed a call for countries to develop and release long-term low emissions development strategies by next year. The forum communique said this may include commitments and strategies to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\n",

      "Text: The fertile land of Norfolk is home to a host of stately homes, rare wildlife and more ponds than any other county. Now, estates in the area are trying to hunt down ancient “ghost ponds” in the hopes of reviving centuries-old seeds and discovering long-lost plants. Botanists believe that this will lead to new plant discoveries; seeds can survive for centuries under layers of leaves and mud so once they are given water and exposed to sunlight the plants will grow. Already, six plants of the endangered wetland flower grass-poly have been found at the edge of an old cattle-watering pond on the Heydon estate in north Norfolk. The species had not been seen in the county since the early 1900s. Recent research by University College London shows that Norfolk lost around 8,000 ponds after the 1950s, and there are an estimated 23,000 at present. Not only are these ghost ponds revealing lost plants, it is also quicker and easier to restore an old pond than to create a new one, as the biodiversity quickly returns to rediscovered watering holes. Jake Fiennes is the estate manager at Holkham Hall, which is owned by the Earl of Leicester. He has committed to nature-friendly farming, boosting numbers of wading birds and restoring wetlands across the 25,000-acre estate. Fiennes has brought in experts to study the plants in his newly flooded wetlands to see if there is anything of note, and is eagerly scrutinising old maps to find the ghost ponds on the estate. “We are going through a process, trying to find the maps, where you can identify where these ghost ponds are,” he said. “There are a few pockets [at Holkham] where you have natural springs, and it’s trying to see where in the past those areas were drained and filled in, and then how we can recreate some of these natural features that we’ve lost,” he said. He is hoping that rare plants will be revived at Holkham, explaining: “The resilience of aquatic seed banks is phenomenal. Given the right conditions, these seeds that have been underground for decades can germinate. That’s very exciting.” He has been convincing other farmers to revive old ponds, arguing that they add value to land. “There’s some great examples of ponds that have dried up or have become shaded by tree growth because they were considered as a hindrance as opposed to an asset,” he said. “At first, it looks like a lot of black sludge and within a year, you have nature, rare plants, plants potentially that haven’t been there for decades. Amphibians start to move in, dragonflies. So it’s one of the most pleasurable places.” Prince Charles has also committed to restoring nature at Sandringham, and the estate has taken part in a series of initiatives with Natural England and with its neighbours at the Wild Ken Hill estate. “Sandringham Estate is always looking for opportunities to engage with local conservation efforts, and would welcome the chance to find out more about the Norfolk Pond Project,” a spokesperson said. Wild Ken Hill is busy recreating its lost ponds using historical Ordnance Survey maps to find the tell-tale circles of blue. Dominic Buscall, the project manager, said: “These ponds are already developing into wonderful oases for wildlife. We’re hugely supportive of the Norfolk Pond Project.” Down the road, the National Trust is hunting for ancient ponds at the Felbrigg Estate, a 17th-century manor. It has found six lost ponds which were marked out by wet depressions and crop marks in the fields. It is hoped these will attract aquatic wildlife as well as revealing long-lost wetland plants. “We expect these ponds to establish much quicker than the new ponds we are creating,” a spokesperson said. “Ponds are vital parts of the waterscape providing aquatic habitats between rivers and lakes. By restoring and creating more ponds through the rural landscape we are able to create links between habitats, becoming more ‘joined up’.”\n",

      "Text: Grammy-award winning star Pharrell Williams has called on world leaders to deliver millions of green jobs around the world, as a crucial part of tackling climate change. “I’m passionate about two big issues: climate change; and education and skills for young people,” said Williams, whose song Happy was a global hit in 2014. “Climate change is one of the most defining issues of our time, one that threatens our very existence on Earth. And we’ve also got another serious problem on our hands: millions of young people who don’t have jobs.” Williams, who with Al Gore is organising the Live Earth music event in the run-up to a crunch UN climate change summit in Paris in December, said: “Right now, we have a unique opportunity to tackle climate change and to make sure that young people and our planet have a future that is sustainable for many generations to come. Making economies green could create millions of good, decent jobs all around the world.” Williams’s video message will be screened to the International Labour Organisation’s World of Work summit in Geneva on Thursday, where French president François Hollande and others will discuss the implications of climate change for workers, businesses and communities. “You – the workers, the employers, the governments, the presidents and prime ministers meeting here today – you guys have the opportunity to make a difference,” said Williams. “Make sure that green jobs are right at the top of the agenda when the world meets in Paris this December.” “Job creation is a social imperative with over 200 million people unemployed and staggering rates of youth unemployment in many countries,” said Peter Poschen, director of the ILO enterprises department. “Policies to protect the climate and preserve the environment can actually create substantially more jobs than the ‘business as usual’ growth. Our review of global and over 30 national assessments concludes that creating up to 60 million additional jobs by 2030 is perfectly possible.” Poschen said: “Climate change and the degradation of natural resources increasingly disrupt economic activity and destroy jobs. The ILO puts the productivity losses generated by climate change alone at 7.%.” Williams was involved in the first Live Earth concerts, which played around the world in 2007. The 2015 Live Earth events were due to take place on every inhabited continent on 18 June. But in May the events were postponed, with the organisers now promising to hold a free event in Paris in the autumn.\n",

      "Text: An overhaul of the EU’s flagship trading scheme for cutting carbon emissions by European industries has been approved by the member states. The agreement to reform the emissions trading system comes after almost two years’ of discussions but just two weeks after the European parliament voted in favour of a new directive. The acceleration in the EU’s efforts to toughen up the carbon reduction regime illustrates widespread acknowledgement of the need to plug loopholes in current legislation. The emissions trading system (ETS) is the EU’s key policy for combating climate change by reducing emissions from more than 11,000 installations in the power sector and energy intensive industries. The policy involves a market-based cap and trade system which forces companies to buy allowances to emit carbon. There have been widespread concerns that emissions were not being sufficiently capped due to an oversupply of “allowances” on the carbon market. ETS was introduced 12 years ago and initially worked well but prices plummeted after 2008 following the economic downturn. Under the proposed directive – now due for deliberation by the European parliament – the number of allowances can be gradually reduced, to push up their cost and provide an incentive for industries to adopt cleaner technologies. The cap on emissions will fall by 2.2% a year – the so-called linear reduction factor – until at least 2024. It is hoped that the new regime will deliver greater cuts in greenhouse gases while providing protection for energy-intensive industries. The highest performing 10% of factories and other installations will receive all their allowances for free, and a fund of up to €12bn (£10.2bn) will be established to help industry innovate and invest in technology. Miguel Arias Cañete, the European commissioner for climate action and energy, said: “Less than two weeks after the vote by parliament, today’s agreement demonstrates once more the European Union’s strong commitment to show leadership on climate action and help drive the global transition to clean energy. I count on everybody’s best efforts to swiftly initiate the negotiations between the council and parliament.” The revision of the ETS will now be negotiated in trialogue meetings between the parliament, European council and European commission. Environmental campaigners claim that the reformed ETS does still not do enough. A proposal to remove the rights of big polluters, such as the cement industry, from receiving free carbon credits, was not passed by the European parliament in February, frustrating many. However, the Conservative party’s energy and climate change spokesman Ian Duncan MEP, who steered the legislation revising the ETS scheme through the European parliament, said the new directive would be a crucial first step. “I am pleased the council has come to a position in good time. It is important we press ahead with this vital piece of climate-change legislation. There are many positive elements in the council position but still much work to do.”\n",

      "Text: In a new study published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, with an accompanying app for the public, scientists at MIT compare the carbon pollution from today’s cars to the international 2°C climate target. In order to meet that target, overall emissions need to decline dramatically over the coming decades. The MIT team compared emissions from 125 electric, hybrid, and gasoline cars to the levels we need to achieve from the transportation sector in 2030, 2040, and 2050 to stay below 2°C global warming. They also looked at the cost efficiency of each car, including vehicle, fuel, and maintenance costs. The bottom line: The MIT app allows consumers to check how their own vehicles – or cars they’re considering purchasing – stack up on the carbon emissions and cost curves. As co-author Jessika Trancik noted, The study used average US fuel and electricity prices over the decade of 2004–2013 (e.g. $3.14 per gallon of gasoline and 12 cents per kilowatt-hour), and the app allows consumers to test different fuel costs. The lifetime of a car is estimated at 14 years and about 170,000 miles. As co-author Marco Miotti explained, As the chart in the lower right corner of the above figure shows, when only accounting for the vehicle purchase cost, gasoline-powered cars are the cheapest. However, hybrid and electric vehicles have lower fuel and regular maintenance costs. In the US, there are also federal rebates that bring the consumer costs down further yet, so the cheapest electric cars (in cost per distance driven) cost less than the cheapest gasoline cars. When including state tax rebates like in California, electric cars are by far the best deal available. Some might object that it’s unfair to include tax rebates, and the MIT app allows for a comparison with or without those rebates. However, as Trancik noted, the app is aimed at consumers, and for them the rebates are a reality. Moreover, the cost of gasoline in the USA does not reflect the costs inflicted by its carbon pollution via climate change. Over the lifetime of the car, the electric car tax rebates roughly offset the gasoline carbon pollution subsidy. Gasoline combustion releases other pollutants that result in additional societal costs as well. As the study notes, most of today’s hybrids and plug-in hybrids meet the 2030 climate targets, and electric cars beat them. However, if we’re going to stay below the internationally-accepted ‘danger limit’ of 2°C global warming above pre-industrial temperatures, the US needs to achieve about an 80% cut in emissions by 2050. As co-author Geoffrey Supran noted, The good news is that we already have the necessary technology available today. Another recent study from MIT’s Trancik Lab found that today’s lowest-cost electric vehicles meet the daily range requirements of 87% of cars on the road, even if they can only recharge once a day. And the technology is quickly advancing; Chevrolet and Tesla will soon release electric cars with 200 mile-per-charge range and before-rebate prices under $40,000.  Solar and wind energy prices continue to fall rapidly as well, as we progress toward a “renewable energy revolution.” In short, to avoid dangerous climate change we need to transition to electric cars that are fueled by low-carbon electricity sources. Those are precisely the technologies that today are becoming increasingly popular, cheap, and technologically advanced. In the US today, it’s already true that the most cost-effective and climate-friendly vehicles are electric, and the technology continues to improve rapidly.\n",

      "Text: When she returned to her home in the village of Knutton, outside Newcastle-under-Lyme, after a trip to London on Thursday, the landfill fumes hit Helen Vincent like a brick wall. “We were saying to each other: ‘Oh how nice was the fresh air in London?’ You won’t hear many people say that,” she laughed. Vincent had been in London for a landmark high court ruling which ordered the Environment Agency to do more to protect five-year-old Mathew Richards from the landfill’s hydrogen sulphide fumes, which doctors said were shortening his life expectancy. “It feels like the biggest victory just for someone to say yes, we believe you. We’ve been hitting our heads against a wall for so long with this,” said Vincent. “We’re realistic, we know no one’s got a magic wand which is going to make it go away overnight. But now at least we can see some light at the end of the tunnel.” Walleys Quarry landfill, situated on the edge of the village of Silverdale, has caused issues for years, but it was at the start of 2021 that hydrogen sulphide levels recorded at the site exceeded World Health Organization guidelines. Hundreds of people in the surrounding area say they have suffered sore throats, itchy eyes, nosebleeds, headaches and sleep deprivation, while schoolchildren have been kept inside at lunchtimes to avoid the fumes. Sian Rooney lives more than a mile from the landfill but had to use her inhaler more regularly before moving on to an oral tablet for her asthma as her breathing got worse. “It’s frightening for your health to deteriorate without any warning,” she said. “I definitely believe it’s to do with the landfill. When I went to Devon for two weeks, I literally didn’t need any medication, but as soon as I got home, my asthma got worse quite quickly.” She also fears for her four-year-old son, who coughs more when the fumes are bad. “For a long time I couldn’t sleep at all because I was absolutely terrified of what it was doing to him,” she said. “When the fumes start coming out, my first thing is to run, turn the air purifier up and put it in his room to stop the fumes getting in.” A community health survey of 1,881 people in the nearby area, conducted in June, found that 83% had reported physical or mental health effects from the landfill, and 24% had discussed their problems with a GP. A total of 144 people had been prescribed medication as a result. The survey, submitted to the high court as evidence of the landfill’s wider community impact, contained dozens of distressing accounts from parents of the effects on their children, with many being forced to take time off school. “My two-year-old is consistently congested, coughing, not eating and sleep deprived,” wrote one, while another said: “My daughter started having nosebleeds out of the blue … she had nine nosebleeds in seven days, she has had to stop doing PE at school. She wakes during the night from coughing and has been having a lot more headaches to the point she cries while holding her head.” Mental health problems have also soared; the local NHS trust and Mind have recruited a counsellor specifically to deal with problems apparently caused by the landfill. “Personally, because of sleep deprivation I was referred to mental health services at work,” said Vincent. “But there’s people a lot worse than me.” Work is ongoing to “cap” parts of the site in order to reduce fumes, but outside the landfill on Friday morning Dr Mick Salt, a radiation physicist who has become a local expert on the landfill emissions, said he was surprised the EA weren’t on site after the ruling. “The timescale for change is so tight, they should be here today making sure that temporary capping material is going on. The targets in the ruling are actually very harsh,” Salt said. He spends up to 10 hours a week monitoring emissions and holding authorities to account on the issue: “When I see a regulator or a large, multimillion pound company trying to steamroll over a community and dazzle them with science, I just stand in the way.” The villages around the landfill have some of the highest rates of deprivation in England, which many believe may be part of the reason why the issue has been unaddressed for so long. “This case was really shocking to me, and I don’t think it would have happened in many other parts of the country,” said Rebekah Carrier, the solicitor who represented Mathew at the high court. For the people living around Silverdale, Thursday’s high court ruling was a huge milestone in their ongoing battle to “stop the stink”. “We do feel vindicated,” said Rooney. “I just hope this ruling finally forces them to act more decisively and urgently.” A spokesperson from Walleys Quarry said: “We have noted the judgment and will take advice on what it means on a practical operational level, given significant changes have been in progress for some time. “We will work with the Environment Agency and other local stakeholders to continue our work to mitigate local concerns and update the community as appropriate.”\n",

      "Text: The UK government is providing a €700m (£600m) guarantee for the billionaire Jim Ratcliffe to build the biggest petrochemical plant in Europe in 30 years that will turbocharge plastic production. The huge petrochemical plant has been described as a “carbon bomb” by campaigners. Being constructed in the Belgian city of Antwerp by Ratcliffe’s company Ineos, it will bring plastic production to Europe on a scale not seen before, just as countries are trying to negotiate a binding global treaty to tackle the growing problem of plastic pollution. More than 350m metric tonnes of plastic waste is produced a year, and by 2060 plastic waste is set to increase to 1bn metric tonnes. Antwerp is a key production centre for plastic in Europe and has created pollution from plastic pellets and emissions that supercharge global heating, campaigners say. But despite admitting the plant’s adverse impact on climate, biodiversity, the environment and the risks to social and human health, the British government has provided financial guarantees of €700m to support the building of Project One in Antwerp. The support from the UK government’s export finance department, an arm of the Department for Business and Trade, to Ratfliffe, now a high-profile part-owner of Manchester United Football Club, exceeds that promised by the same department for countries in Africa and the Middle East to adapt to climate breakdown. Ratcliffe has been lobbying politicians in Europe pushing back against green policies which he claims are driving away investment. Project One will import fracked shale gas from the US, to provide the ethane for the cracker plant that will produce 1450 kilotons of ethylene, which is the building block of plastic, a year. Details of the financial support from the UK government emerged as environmental NGOs prepared a new legal challenge to stop Ratcliffe building Project One. The UK government argues its financial guarantees are in line with its support for a global transition towards net zero. But Jacob Kean-Hammerson, of the Environmental Investigations Agency in the UK, said: “Ineos is a big part of the plastic production supply chain and plastic producers themselves. “By supporting this plant the UK government is financing a huge climate emissions project. What we need is additional funds for climate-related adaptation but the UK is giving more money to a potentially huge emitter than to countries to help them adapt to the impacts of climate change.” Documents show UK Export Finance (UKEF) is aware of the climate impact of Project One. “The project was deemed to have potential to cause a number of adverse environmental and social impacts both during construction and operation,” the UK documents said. Officials carried out a “desktop review” rather than visiting the site at Antwerp. They said a “proposed suite of controls as part of the project’s environmental and social management systems, if implemented effectively, should facilitate the management of these impacts”. UKEF said Ineos had promised to become carbon neutral for Scope 1 and 2 emissions 10 years after the start of operations, which did not therefore hinder the ability of the EU to meet current climate-related policy or international commitments, including the Paris agreement. An Ineos spokesperson said: “Project One will produce the raw material essential for medical products, insulation, transport and packaging. It will have the lowest carbon footprint compared with any plant of its kind in Europe. And by applying state of the art technology, it has a clear roadmap to carbon neutrality within 10 years of startup. Europe needs to be permitted to renew its manufacturing technology and we will strongly defend this project in the court.” The production of plastic is, however, hugely carbon intensive. Over 99% of plastic comes from fossil fuels and plastic production is by far the largest industrial oil, gas and electricity user in the EU, according to the NGO Break Free from Plastic. Fossil fuels cannot be replaced as a feedstock in the petrochemical industry, something Ineos acknowledges. Jeroen Dagevos, of the Plastic Soup Foundation, one of the NGOs challenging Project One, said: “There is a huge problem of plastic pollution from nurdles already in Antwerp and the Netherlands. This plant will bring US-scale plastic production to Europe. The nurdles are everywhere, in the EU alone up to 23bn plastic nurdles end up in the environment every day. “The plastic pollution is not under control. Almost half of plastic production today is for consumer goods, single-use packaging that will be thrown away. We need the industry to solve the problem of pollution they have created, not build a huge new plant to massively increase plastic production.” The UK said Ineos had promised that only 10% of the ethylene produced would be used for single-use plastic. The rest will be used for construction goods, including pipes and cable ducting, according to UKEF. Dagevos said: “How will they monitor this? There are no controls over who is buying the ethylene. This will just boost the production of single-use plastic packaging and throwaway consumer goods in Europe.” A spokesperson for the government said: “UK Export Finance helps UK businesses to win, deliver and get paid for overseas contracts. “Our financing guarantee for Project One secures new export opportunities and is consistent with our continued support for a global transition towards net zero.” Ineos is publicly pushing back against scientific evidence of the human health and environmental and climate impacts of plastic pollution. Research shows that microplastics have been found in human blood for the first time. The global production of single-use plastic is fuelling global heating and less than 10% of the 7bn tonnes of plastic waste already generated globally has been recycled. But Ratcliffe’s company says on its website that plastic needs be treated with “less emotion” and defends the production of single-use plastic, saying less than 2g of plastic package protects a cucumber. “This will extend its ‘shelf life’ by 11 days! A little bit of plastic will prevent a whole lot of food waste.”\n",

      "Text: Connoisseurs of fine wine should be drinking a toast to global warming, according to new research. Higher temperatures in France are producing exceptional vintages, but scientists have warned that if the trend continues too long, the current run of outstanding grape harvests could end. Records dating back more than 500 years show that wine grapes across France are now being harvested two weeks earlier on average than they were in the past. Wine grape maturation is accelerated by warmer temperatures and delayed by rain, and earlier harvests are generally associated with higher quality wines. The main reason for the change is climate change pushing up temperatures in the absence of drought, it is claimed. Dr Elizabeth Wolkovich, from Harvard University in the US, who took part in the research published in the journal Nature Climate Change, said: “There are two big points in this paper. The first is that harvest dates are getting much earlier, and all the evidence points to it being linked to climate change. Especially since 1980, when we see a major turning point for temperatures in the northern hemisphere, we see harvest dates across France getting earlier and earlier. “The bad news is that if we keep warming the globe we will reach a tipping point. “The trend, in general, is that earlier harvests lead to higher-quality wine, but you can connect the dots here ... we have several data points that tell us there is a threshold we will probably cross in the future where higher temperatures will not produce higher quality.” There is a French word, “terroir”, that vintners use to describe the set of environmental factors affecting wine grape quality. It is because of terroir that the wine grape is one of the best barometers of climate change, say the scientists. “At the heart of a good wine is climate,” said Wolkovich. “So the grapes are a very good canary in the coal mine. “You want to harvest when the grapes are perfectly ripe, when they’ve had enough time to accumulate just the right balance between acid and sugar. “For much of France, there have been times when it’s difficult to get the exact harvest date growers want because the climate wasn’t warm enough that year. But climate change means the grapes are maturing faster.” In the past, early wine grape harvests have always required both above-average air temperatures and the added kick of a late-season drought, leading to warmer, drier soils and rapidly-maturing grapes. Prior to the 1980s, droughts were necessary for early harvests - without them, vineyards could not quite get hot enough. Since then, overall air warming alone has pushed summer temperatures over the early harvest threshold, the research shows. Throughout the 20th century France warmed by about 1.5C, and the upward climb has continued. Lead author Dr Benjamin Cook, of the US space agency Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said: “Now, it’s become so warm thanks to climate change, grape growers don’t need drought to get these very warm temperatures. “After 1980, the drought signal effectively disappears. That means there’s been a fundamental shift in the large-scale climate under which other, local factors operate.” The wine-growing regions affected included some familiar names, among them Alsace, Champagne, Burgundy and Languedoc. Vineyards in these areas grow finicky pinot noirs, chardonnays and other varieties that thrive within specific climate niches and are especially good when they can be harvested early. “So far, a good year is a hot year,” said Wolkovich. But she pointed out that a foretaste of what might be to come occurred in 2003 when a searing heat wave led to the earliest French grape harvest ever recorded. In that year, grapes were picked a full month ahead of their usual time. However, the wines they produced were mediocre. Wolkovich added: “That may be a good indicator of where we’re headed. If we keep pushing the heat up, vineyards can’t maintain that forever.” Across the world, experts have found that each 1C of warming brings grape harvests forward roughly six or seven days. A 2011 study led by Dr Yves Tourre, from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, suggested that a combination of natural climate variability and human-induced warming could force pinot noir grapes out of many parts of Burgundy. Other reports indicated that Bordeaux might lose its cabernets and merlots. One controversial study published in 2013 predicted that by 2050 some two-thirds of today’s wine regions may no longer have climates suitable for the grapes they now grow. As the world gets hotter, famous-name wine grapes might find unlikely new homes, possibly even making southern England the new Champagne region, according to some experts.\n",

      "Text: Australia’s greenhouse gas accounting underestimates national emissions by about 10%, largely due to a failure to properly recognise the impact of methane released during gas production, an analysis has found. In late June, the energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, amended laws to reflect a scientific consensus that methane – a highly potent but short-lived greenhouse gas that leaks during gas processing – plays a greater role in heating the planet than previously thought. The change is expected to increase Australia’s reported annual emissions by about 3% compared with what they otherwise would have been. Tim Baxter, a former University of Melbourne climate law expert, now a senior researcher with the Climate Council, said the government update was belated as it was based on a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published six years ago. But he said the change did not fully reflect the panel’s conclusions, including that methane from fossil fuels was more damaging than from living sources, and was yet to factor in more recent peer-reviewed evidence that methane’s heating role was even greater than estimated in 2014. Baxter found that if the methane emitted in Australia was measured according to the latest science it would increase annual emissions by more than 50m tonnes a year, the equivalent of Sweden’s total carbon pollution. His analysis is included in a submission to the New South Wales authorities on the controversial Narrabri gas project and will form the basis for an upcoming report. He said the Morrison government, which is backing a “gas-fired recovery” from the Covid-19 recession and is considering whether to underwrite new gas infrastructure including major pipelines, was failing to report the full impact of its emissions. “It’s no surprise to anyone who has been paying attention that the federal government is miles behind when it comes to keeping up with the science of climate change,” Baxter said. “It is still ignoring the extra impact of fossil fuel methane compared to other sources and still failing to consider the full impact of those emissions on natural feedbacks. The government is several steps behind key scientific developments that have occurred over the past seven years.” Methane lasts in the atmosphere for only about 12 years but is much more potent than carbon dioxide. Scientists have found the level of atmospheric methane had increased significantly since 2007 after a relatively flat period, but they are unsure why. Gas emits about half the carbon dioxide released from coal when burned, but Global Energy Monitor, a US research and advocacy group, found the role of fugitive methane emissions from new gas developments in global heating was likely to be as large as or larger than the expansion of coal power. A spokesman for the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources said it was simplistic for Baxter to conclude that methane impacts were underestimated in government data. He said Australia was acting in line with a 2018 international agreement that the warming power of methane and other gases set out in the IPCC’s 2014 report would be reflected in greenhouse reporting by 2023. “The analysis is not accurate,” the spokesman said. On Tuesday, 25 leading scientists released a letter to the chief scientist, Alan Finkel, warning his advocacy for increased use of gas-fired electricity was at odds with the Paris agreement and not consistent with a plan to secure a safe climate. “There is no role for an expansion of the gas industry,” they wrote. “The combustion of natural gas is now the fastest-growing source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, the most important greenhouse gas.” Finkel responded that he shared their vision for the expansion of renewable energy but he believed it would be “faster, more economical and more reliable” if supported by gas-fired electricity generation “in the near to medium term”. The chief scientist said he had not commented on an expanded role for gas in industry – backed by the government and Scott Morrison’s handpicked National Covid Coordinating Commission – having focused solely on the electricity grid. The Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) last month found additional gas-fired power was an option, but not essential, for an electricity grid increasingly based on renewable energy, and gas prices would need to stay at lower levels than expected if new gas was to compete with pumped hydro, batteries and other alternatives. The prime minister repeated his strong support for gas in parliament on Tuesday. He said gas was an important transition fuel and expanding the supply was critical to Australia’s economic recovery from the Covid-19 recession. “That is why we want to see more of it and get more out of the ground,” he said. The update announced by Taylor increased the estimated warming potential of methane – effectively, how much heat it traps – from 25 times greater than carbon dioxide to 28 times greater, calculated over a century. The change matters because methane emissions are converted to their “carbon dioxide equivalent” and then counted in national CO2 emissions. The 2014 IPCC report suggested the warming power of methane from fossil fuels was 30 times greater than CO2. The warming power of “biogenic methane” – released from living organisms such as cows – was 28 times greater. A later reassessment, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters in 2016, found it was greater still: 34 times greater than CO2 for “fossil methane” and 32 times greater for biogenic methane. Baxter said these figures were still not truly representative as they did not factor in the feedback effects caused when greenhouse gases are released. The IPCC report in 2014 cited research that found the feedback from methane emissions increased its warming potential by a further 20%. Baxter calculated this would lift the warming rate for biogenic methane to 39 and for fossil methane to 40. He said the additional, unexplained methane in the atmosphere suggested the emissions from the gas industry were being systematically underreported.\n",

      "Text: Livestock groups have been lobbying the UN to support more meat and dairy production before a high-profile summit on food sustainability, documents reveal.  Most experts agree that livestock are responsible for at least 14% of global emissions, while a study published last week found the use of animals for meat causes twice the planet-heating gases that plant-based foods do.  The UN Food Systems Summit (UN FSS), taking place this week in New York, aims to make global agricultural systems more sustainable, billing itself as a transformational “people’s summit”.  But documents obtained by Greenpeace Unearthed – the investigative arm of environmental NGO Greenpeace – and seen by the Guardian, show livestock industry bodies threatening to withdraw if others in their discussion group at the summit do not share their “common goal”.  In the months leading up to the summit, discussion groups – known as clusters – worked to produce position papers offering sustainable food system solutions.  In one draft paper, dated 15 June, members of the “sustainable livestock” cluster stated that “advances in intensive livestock systems” mean they can “contribute to the preservation of planetary resources and effective delivery of nutrition”. Environmental and other experts have advised however that lower levels of animal protein production and consumption are critical to reducing climate breakdown and protecting the environment. At almost the same time as the livestock group’s draft paper was released, 11 new members were added to the cluster, including a farm animal welfare NGO and environmental scientists. The addition sparked a letter of complaint to the UN from some of the original members, describing the new members as wishing “to further an ideological anti-livestock stance”. The letter, dated 26 June, which threatened the signatories’ withdrawal, said although it understood the “need for inclusiveness”, to function well “the group must share a common goal” and described the addition of new members as “a clear breach of the trust”. It was signed by the International Meat Secretariat, the International Poultry Council, Global Dairy Platform, the International Dairy Federation, the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, the International Egg Commission and the International Feed Industry Federation and an animal pharmaceutical representative called HealthforAnimals. As yet, no members have withdrawn. Michael Fakhri, UN special rapporteur on the right to food, criticised the summit’s failure to consult and involve voices from outside the meat industry from the beginning. “It started with the meat industry itself, and then included people who wish to softly transition from the current system. Only towards the end were more critical voices invited.” One of the 11 new additions to the cluster, Philip Lymbery, chief executive of NGO Compassion in World Farming, said he found the original members to be “heavily weighted toward industry interests”. On joining, Lymbery said he found the solution offered by the cluster was “substantially more livestock production” with some additional “technical innovations” that would make production more sustainable. Another new member, Matthew Hayek, assistant professor of environmental studies at New York University, said he believed the UN FSS should not have given “incumbent industries a platform to deny or minimise the scientific consensus”. Of the three position papers produced by the cluster for the summit, only one describes the disadvantages of industrial farming and clearly states that “a significant reduction in global consumption of meat and dairy is needed” to meet the Paris climate targets. “Our perspective on reducing consumption was limited to only one of three solution papers; the other two still primarily emphasise [livestock] industry-aligned solutions,” Hayek said. One of the signatories of the livestock group’s letter of complaint, Hsin Huang, secretary general of the International Meat Secretariat (IMS), said he found the idea of the IMS lobbying the UN FSS “laughable”.  Disputing the claim that livestock industry groups were the first to be contacted by the UN FSS, Huang said the IMS and other private livestock groups were only formally invited to join the livestock cluster on 4 June this year – although he said “voluntary clusters” had been working before that.  Asked about reducing animal numbers, particularly of intensively farmed animals in developed countries, Huang said industrial agriculture had answered customer needs by delivering safe, cheap foods with a longer shelf life.  He added that the IMS was “extremely supportive of better animal welfare” and not “necessarily against the idea of reducing” animal numbers, but it was a complicated issue. For example, he said, reducing animal numbers “in developed countries will only lead to more animals produced in less efficient systems in developing countries. And that will make emissions issues, environmental issues, resource use issues and welfare problems worse.” A joint statement from the Global Dairy Platform and the International Dairy Platform did not directly address the lobbying issues, nor other criticisms raised, but said: “The global community needs the recommendations made by the Food Systems Summit to be balanced and not based on ideology or tradeoffs which could put long-term food security and livelihoods at risk.” Asked when the livestock cluster discussions had begun, and which groups were invited first, the UN said in an emailed statement that the “Sustainable Livestock Solutions Cluster evolved during the open public engagement process that took place in two ‘phases’ between December 2020 and May 2021.” The email confirmed that new members were introduced to the livestock cluster in June but did not give a date. It added that as “a solutions summit” the UN food summit “aimed to create a space for new and sometimes difficult conversations, grounded in science,” and as a “people’s summit, the approach was to ensure all voices are heard, including those from the most marginalised farmers to governments to private companies, accepting that sometimes there are divergent viewpoints.” Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

      "Text: Haze over cities is a visual reminder of the air pollution we breathe. This is less obvious than the coal smoke induced gloom that Victorians suffered. In the 1880s central London had just 17% of the winter sunshine that was measured in the countryside. This had only improved to 45% by 1916–20. However, even modern haze is still reducing sunlight in cities. Scientists find that in Delhi air pollution over the city is reducing the efficiency of solar panels by between 12% and 17%, depending on the type of photovoltaic technology. Losses are between 9% and 13% in Beijing, and around 2% in London and Los Angeles. In the worst cities air pollution could affect the viability of solar energy. It also means money – Los Angeles’ expanding solar electricity sector could be losing about $6m to $9ma year by 2020. During the 1920s medics thought that smog-induced lack of sunlight caused vitamin D deficiency and the rickets which plagued the UK’s urban poor. Sunlight therapy is no longer used for respiratory diseases but recently scientists at King’s College London have looked again at vitamin D and found that it might help protect lung cells from air pollution.\n",

      "Text: Biofuel use needs to increase to help fight climate change as liquid fuels will be needed by aircraft and ships for many decades to come, finds a new report requested by the UK government. The Royal Academy of Engineering report says, however, that some biofuels, such as diesel made from food crops, have led to more emissions than those produced by the fossil fuels they were meant to replace. Instead, the report says, rising biofuel production should make more use of waste, such as used cooking oil and timber. Ten years ago biofuels were seen as ideal, low-carbon, replacements for the liquid fossil fuels that power the majority of the world’s transport systems. But concerns grew that first-generation biofuels, made from food crops, were increasing food prices and were often as polluting as fossil fuels when all factors in their production were considered. The new report combines more than 250 analyses of the impact of biofuels around the world, including how demand for food-based biofuels drives the destruction of forests and peatlands when farmers expand into additional areas – the most contentious issue. It also warns that the promise of clean biofuels from algae remains far off, with current versions much worse than diesel. The researchers found that when land use changes were accounted for, all the significant types of biodiesel – palm oil, soybean, rapeseed and sunflowers – caused more carbon emissions than diesel itself. Accounting for land use change is complex, but even if this factor is ignored only palm oil has led to a reduction of 50% in emissions compared with diesel, the level required by EU rules. Bioethanol, which replaces petrol (gasoline) and is produced from corn, wheat, sugarcane and sugar beet, failed to meet the 50% reduction when land use change was included. Wheat-based bioethanol was the worst performer, actually producing more carbon emissions than petrol. By contrast, the use of waste from farms and forestry, and from used cooking oil, to make biofuels, always cut emissions compared with the performance of fossil fuels. In some cases, such as using waste stalks and cobs from corn, biofuels could have near-zero emissions overall. Under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations order, biofuel must be blended into petrol and diesel in the UK today at a rate of 4.75%. A rise towards the 10% EU-wide target by 2020 has stalled due to the environmental concerns. The authors says their report is intended to break that impasse. “Overall our evidence [is] that the sustainability risk of increasing levels of biofuels can be managed and the government should be confident of increasing the mandate for biofuels,” said Nilay Shah, a professor at Imperial College London and one of the team who produced the report. In the future, non-food crops such as miscanthus grass, could be grown on poor quality land, he said. Wheat is an important source of bioethanol in the UK, with crops covering about 99,000 acres (more than 40,000 hectares) in 2015-16. But it is not clear if the land use changes that make wheat a poor biofuel apply in the UK, as the study combined data from all over the world. The 2020 target was going to be missed, both in the UK and elsewhere, said Shah, as ramping up production in a sustainable way would take time. “That would be a big challenge – realistically it is a five- to 10-year timescale,” he said. Despite the fast growth in electric cars, Shah said biofuels would be needed as a key part of tackling climate change because no significant alternatives for liquid fuels were available for aircraft, ships and long-distance HGVs. “The scope for electrification is quite limited for at least several decades.” Progress towards producing better biofuels has been challenging. British Airways abandoned a £340m scheme to create jet fuel from London’s rubbish in January 2016, although in the same month the US navy launched its first aircraft carriers powered by biofuels. James Beard, a climate and energy specialist at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF-UK), said: “Unsustainable biofuels can do more damage than good and should be phased out. But not all biofuels are bad. Certified sustainable biofuels will be needed in sectors that are tricky to de-carbonise, like aviation.” John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “While those promoting biofuels start with good intentions, the tendency, especially when it comes to land use, is for things to go horribly wrong. A much safer way to cut emissions is promoting energy efficiency, electric vehicles, and looking at mobility in a much broader way than just how to fuel people’s cars.”\n",

      "Text: A surge in pig and poultry farming in Northern Ireland has built a multimillion-pound industry, feeding British consumers chicken and pork. But it is creating a climate and pollution headache for politicians. After a decade of growth, the country has a poultry population of 25 million and pig production has risen to almost 1.5 million, with most of the meat exported to Great Britain. The figures show Northern Ireland has no shortage of ingredients for sausages in the midst of a bitter row between the EU and the UK over a looming ban on chilled meats traded from Great Britain into the region.  But the country is struggling to dispose of its animal waste sustainably – and may need to export more than a third of it. Rising phosphate and nitrate levels are also threatening the country’s waterways and pushing the UK over international ammonia limits. Advisory bodies have told politicians that as much as 35% of animal waste may need to be exported to improve water and soil quality in the region, and that “agricultural activities remain a significant and increasing pressure on water quality” in Northern Ireland. Only one lake out of 21 in Northern Ireland is considered of good status under the EU’s water framework directive, legislation intended to improve river water quality.   The devolved administration’s first climate bill moved to its second reading last month, setting a 2045 net zero carbon target for Northern Ireland. Farming groups claim the target could wipe out half of the country’s livestock farmers if it was enforced. A quarter of Northern Ireland’s poultry litter is exported, but there are no figures on the full extent of animal waste exports. Slurry and concentrated solid manure produced by intensive pig and poultry operations is being deposited over the Irish border as far as Wexford, more than 150 miles south. Part of the remainder is shipped to incinerators in Great Britain, including sites at Norfolk and Fife. Material transported to the Irish Republic is largely used as fertiliser or goes to anaerobic digester plants for biofuel. Cross-border pollution from Northern Ireland’s excess waste disposal has triggered legal action, with cases being prepared by Friends of the Earth and Ireland’s national trust body, An Taisce, which owns land straddling the frontier between Monaghan and Tyrone.   The Green party says 98% of special areas of conservation in Northern Ireland exceed critical loads of nitrogen, with some by up to 300% or more. James Orr, Friends of the Earth Northern Ireland director, says transboundary pollution is the result of years of regulatory inaction either side of the border. He argues that intensive farming practices have led to: “Air pollution, chronic water pollution and also habitat degradation through the ripping out of natural and semi-natural habitats for intensification.” “We’re a centre for agribusiness in Northern Ireland, which means we’re now saturated with excrement,” said Orr. “And not just ourselves, but our neighbours, too, are paying the price.” The growth in intensive pig and poultry farming in the country continues, with planning decisions awaited on mega units set to house tens of thousands of pigs and chickens in Newtownabbey, Fermanagh and Limavady – poised to be some of the UK’s largest intensive livestock farms. The number of intensive poultry farms (with 40,000 or more birds) granted planning permission in Northern Ireland rose from 141 in 2011 to 245 in 2017, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.   During this period, Moy Park, Northern Ireland’s largest company and Europe’s biggest poultry processor, encouraged the construction of hundreds of new poultry houses at Northern Irish farms.   Poultry numbers in Northern Ireland increased by 27% between 2012 and 2020 to almost 25 million. Between 2006 and 2020, the slaughter of home-produced pigs more than doubled in the region – from 717,172 to 1,444,150 – while its breeding herd grew by 31% between 2006 and 2019.   Meanwhile, between 2011 and 2018, Northern Ireland’s pigmeat export sales almost doubled – from £54.8m to £106.2m – as total agri-food exports rose by 77%. About 80% of the region’s meat is exported, with Great Britain its biggest market by some way, accounting for almost two-thirds of agri-food product exports in 2015.  Mark Sutton, an environmental physicist at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, says that, while recognising agriculture represents a large part of the Northern Irish economy, there is a pressing need to meet targets on nitrogen emissions, of which ammonia is one compound – with much of the UK’s climate focus ahead of Cop26 centring on carbon emissions.  Citing damage to nitrogen-sensitive sphagnum moss and peat bogs – which act as carbon sinks – caused by the waste surplus, Sutton argues that measures as straightforward as using newer slurry-spreading machinery and more efficient storage of manure fertiliser could help reduce Northern Ireland’s emissions significantly. “We estimate that something like 80% of [all] the nitrogen inputs that are going into agriculture get wasted,” Sutton said.  “If we want to meet our net zero targets, we need to take action on nitrogen. One of the problems is how fragmented its by-products are – you have ammonia, nitrates in the water and nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas hundreds of times as potent as CO2, coming out of the soils,” he said. Fermanagh and Omagh district councillor Chris McCaffrey said farmers were trying to diversify by “copying this industrial model, which brings massive environmental and public health risks, as well as risks for animal welfare. “We have very low topsoil here in Fermanagh – only a couple of centimetres. So it’s not very long before ammonia and other pollutants get into the water table.” An application for a new 1,000-pig unit in his ward, on the edge of the Derrylin townland, was rejected last year following widespread community opposition.  Northern Ireland’s Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) said it has “developed an ammonia strategy, which will be published for consultation soon. This strategy outlines a comprehensive approach to ammonia reduction and the protection and restoration of habitats.”   “Daera has already taken action to address ammonia in Northern Ireland, including funding a wide-ranging ammonia research programme, publishing a code of good agricultural practice for the reduction of ammonia emissions and supporting farmers financially to invest in ammonia reduction technologies such as low emissions slurry spreading equipment, which reduces the ammonia and water quality impacts of slurry spreading through schemes such as the farm business improvement scheme.” Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

      "Text: African leaders and campaigners are at odds over the way forward for the continent as a critical climate summit begins in Nairobi. Some countries, such as Ethiopia, Kenya, Egypt and South Africa, have been expanding their renewable energy access and leading transition efforts on the continent, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Africa has abundant renewable energy potential, solar power is the cheapest source of energy in most African countries, and as the costs associated with renewables fall, green energy access is becoming more accessible, say energy experts. But African nations with large oil and natural gas reserves – such as Nigeria, an oil-producing country where reserves, regulators believe, will last a few more decades, and Senegal, which has made significant oil and gas discoveries in recent years – argue they should be able to use those resources for economic growth and increased energy access. Other countries such as Namibia are straddling a middle ground, attracting significant investment in renewable energy while exploring the potential of oilfields off its coast over the last few years. The continent is responsible for less than 4% of emissions and with 600 million people across the continent without access to electricity and an expected rise in demand, debate has grown over the last decade on what a “just energy transition” for the continent would entail. Climate campaigners, who convened a peaceful climate march in Nairobi on Monday, say new investments in fossil fuels across the continent set an alarming trend. “We are marching for ambitious renewable energy targets and an end to fossil fuels,” said Hardi Yakubu, of the advocacy network Africans Rising. Wangari Muchiri, the Africa director at the Global Wind Energy Council, said debates around gas could stall critical discussions on what it would take for the continent to undergo “green industrialisation”, such as increased investments in renewables and building the continent’s renewable energy manufacturing capacity. Campaigners believe a fossil fuel phaseout should be on the summit’s agenda. With the dash for gas in Senegal and projects such as the East African crude oil pipeline, Yakubu said, there was no sign of a slowdown. The Africa Climate Summit, hosted by Kenya and the African Union Commission, brings together several African heads of state and government, ministers and UN leaders, including the UN secretary general, António Guterres, and his predecessor Ban Ki-moon. The conference, centred around “green growth and climate finance”, will drive discussions on energy transitions on the continent and barriers to access as countries increasingly question whether African countries, which are generally not saddled with fossil fuel infrastructure, can skip past the traditional high carbon pathways taken by their industrialised counterparts, into renewable energy. On Wednesday, a joint declaration will outline the continent’s position on climate finance and green growth. “No country should ever have to choose between development aspirations and climate action,” reads the Nairobi declaration, seen by the Guardian. The declaration will contain proposals for the establishment of a global carbon tax system that leaders say will increase the availability of climate finance and incentivise countries to cut emissions and call for industrialised countries to accelerate their efforts to reduce emissions, keep their 2009 pledge to provide $100bn in annual climate finance, which has not been met, and to operationalise the loss and damage fund agreed on during Cop27 last year. “Our renewable energy resources … can uplift millions from energy poverty, all while reducing our carbon footprint, continentally and globally,” the Kenyan president, William Ruto, said at the conference opening. Discussion will also be focused on the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI), launched during Cop27 in an effort to expand carbon offsetting activities on the continent, which aims to produce 300m carbon credits annually by 2030 and unlock $6bn (£4.75bn) in revenue by 2030 and more than $120bn (£95bn) by 2050. Leaders see it as a way to unlock much-needed climate financing. Gabon was the first country on the continent to receive a payout in 2019 for reducing emissions. The densely forested central African country, one of the most carbon-positive nations in the world, will receive more than £119m over 10 years. Leaders say the industry has massive export potential for the continent. At the conference, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) committed to buying $450 million of carbon credits from the ACMI. But climate organisations and campaigners have pushed back on carbon market plans, labelling the markets a “dangerous distraction” and a “false solution”, and expressing scepticism over whether carbon offset projects can result in meaningful climate funding and sustainable development, or address the climate crisis. “There is no room for the illusion of offsets in a world where we have exhausted the remaining carbon budget,” said Mohamed Adow, the director of the climate thinktank Power Shift Africa. “The very design of these markets is for us to proffer pollution permits to wealthy industrialised countries and companies, locking them into a high emissions pathway and shifting the burden to African people. It’s actually a new form of colonialism.”\n",

      "Text: The UK’s scheme for ensuring power supplies during the winter months has been suspended after a ruling by the European court of justice that it constitutes illegal state aid. Payments to energy firms under the £1bn capacity market scheme will be halted until the government can win permission from the European commission to restart it. The scheme subsidises owners of coal, gas and other power stations so the plants are ready to ensure that electricity for businesses and homes is available at peak times in winter. The UK has also been blocked from holding any capacity market auctions for energy firms to bid for new contracts to supply backup power in the future. National Grid said ministers had instructed it to indefinitely postpone auctions that had been planned for early 2019. The government said it was disappointed by the judgment but insisted that power supplies were not at risk. On Thursday, the ECJ ruled that the European commission had failed to launch a proper investigation into the UK’s capacity market when it cleared the scheme for state aid approval in 2014. The ruling renders the capacity market unlawful for a “standstill period” while ministers seek state aid approval from the European commission. It is not clear how long that will take, but it could be many months. The court’s surprise judgment was an embarrassment for Greg Clark, the business secretary, who hours later outlined his vision for the future of the power market to energy executives at an event in London. Industry watchers said the decision would send shockwaves throughout the sector. “The consequences are absolutely huge. Immediate cessation of payments is going to have immediate consequences for electricity generators that were relying on them,” said Ed Reed, head of research at analysts Cornwall Insight. While electricity supplies were unlikely to be at risk, he added, companies may seek to recoup lost capacity market revenues through wholesale power prices instead. “The lights are not going to go out. We certainly have enough power stations. But the consequence is the market price might go up.” Tom Glover, UK country chair of RWE, which owns the biggest fleet of gas power plants in the UK, said he was “deeply disappointed” and his company was facing a “significant negative hit” to its earnings. Bernstein Research said the suspension of payments would hit earnings at British Gas owner Centrica, plus RWE, Uniper and SSE. Sara Bell, founder and CEO of Tempus Energy, which started the challenge in 2014, said: “This ruling should ultimately force the UK government to design an energy system that reduces bills by incentivising and empowering customers to use electricity in the most cost-effective way – while maximising the use of climate-friendly renewables.” The company believes that the capacity market favours fossil fuel generation at the expense of alternative ways of securing electricity supplies, such as “demand side reduction”, where companies reduce electricity demand at times of need. The winter of 2017/18 was the first year the capacity market was in effect, with companies due to receive £990m for 2018/19. The scheme works by energy companies bidding years in advance for billpayer-funded subsidies to provide backup power at crunch times during winter. Labour said the ruling meant that the government would have to rethink the market. Alan Whitehead, shadow energy minister, said: “This judgment effectively annuls previous state aid permission to provide subsidies for existing fossil fuel power plants. I have long criticised this bizarre arrangement, which simply throws money at old dirty power stations.” Richard Black, director of the ECIU thinktank, said the ruling should be seen as an opportunity for the government to reshape the market away from fossil fuels and towards battery storage and cleaner technologies. Clark said the government was already in contact with the European commission and seeking state aid approval, so the capacity market could be reinstated. The business secretary used his speech to celebrate the rise of renewables. “Cheap power is now green power,” he said.\n",

      "Text: The Chumash people viewed the Pacific Ocean as their first home. Their territory once spanned 7,000 sq miles, from the rolling hills of Paso Robles to the white sand beaches of Malibu. Now, the region is one of the most expensive in the US, home to resort hotels, vineyards and multimillion-dollar mansions. The average house price in Avila Beach, California, where Violet Sage Walker grew up hunting for grunion in the midnight hours, is $1.9m (£1.5m). “My father would walk across the creek on the backs of steelhead and salmon,” says Walker, the Chumash tribal chair. “They were that abundant. Now the water’s contaminated, from sewage, runoff and overpopulation. In one generation we’ve lost the ability to feed ourselves off the land.” As stewards of that land, however, the Chumash remain an active presence. Today, Walker, her long black skirt rippling in the breeze, is conducting a ceremony for a local surf club that helps veterans connect with the ocean. Along with three other Chumash elders, she blesses a circle of veterans – all standing on their surfboards – with ceremonial sage, and sings an ancestral song used to call to whales. Blue whales, along with southern sea otters, black abalone, snowy plovers and leatherback sea turtles, are just some of the species at risk here. The California coast is experiencing climate breakdown at twice the rate of other parts of the ocean, and acidification, caused by pollution, is the main threat to marine life. Indeed, new development has plagued the area with pollution: pipeline spills dumping thousands of gallons of crude oil into the ocean; leaks from old petrol tanks seeping into groundwater; urban stormwater and agricultural runoffs polluting the streams. The threat of offshore oil drilling looms in the near future. That’s why Walker’s father, Fred Collins, the chief of the Northern Chumash Tribal Council, spent decades advocating to turn 156 miles of coastline here in central California into a national marine sanctuary, which would grant it federal protection. Not only would marine life, from sea otters to kelp forests, be preserved, but the proposed sanctuary would safeguard Chumash traditions. Two days before he died unexpectedly in 2021, he passed to his daughter the legacy of realising his dream. “He told me it was the most important thing he’d ever worked on in his life,” Walker says, as she walks through the early morning ocean fog on Avila Beach. “The sanctuary is a reflection of who we are, our people, and this land.” If successful, it would be the first tribally nominated, tribally led sanctuary on the US mainland. The proposed site will be a co-management initiative between the Chumash, other local tribal groups and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(Noaa). Noaa manages 14 national marine sanctuaries – as well as the Papahānaumokuākea and Rose Atoll marine national monuments – but this would be the first in partnership with an Indigenous group. The sanctuary would stretch from near the coastal village of Cambria, halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles, to just south of Santa Barbara County, encompassing 7,670 sq miles of ocean. “It’s big – it’ll be six times the size of Yosemite,” says Stephen Palumbi, a professor of marine sciences at Stanford University’s Hopkins Marine Station. “The question is – how do you monitor that big an area? How do you understand the dynamics, and relate climate change to what is going to happen in the future?” Palumbi has been working with Walker using technology called environmental DNA, which identifies organisms from minute flecks of cellular material, to survey the proposed area. Monitoring will be key to understanding the impact of offshore development on marine life. “Sanctuaries aren’t national parks,” says Palumbi. “They have a limited role in managing something like fishing. But they do three major things: they’re a great nexus for combining interests by different parties – such as fishing, local landowners, and state fish and wildlife departments. They’re also a structure within the federal government, which means they have access to budget and research resources. And they can take local knowledge and graft it with administration abilities, which is a powerful combination.” Most pressingly, a sanctuary would help safeguard the region against major industrial development, such as oil drilling, a battle that has dragged on for decades. Sanctuaries prohibit the discharging of waste material, altering the seabed, disturbing cultural resources and, crucially, developing oil, gas or mineral mining. Having formally submitted the proposal in July 2015, the Chumash are now painfully close to succeeding. Noaa’s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries is reviewing all public feedback and drafting a management plan to be released as early as this month. Fifteen senators and members of Congress have written a letter urging the designation of the sanctuary, which could happen in early 2024. “It’s got a very good chance of being approved,” says Palumbi. “All the elements are there.” As well as recognising Chumash history, the sanctuary would mark out the area as an internationally significant “ecological transition zone”, where temperatures from the cold north meet the subtropics, creating unique conditions for marine life. It would allow the Chumash to work with scientists to monitor marine life, helping create a new framework for collaboration between western science and traditional ecological knowledge. The Chumash are looking to Mai Ka Pō Mai – a Hawaiian initiative that brings together federal agencies and Indigenous people to manage the land in the north-western Hawaiian islands – for inspiration. For centuries, US government agencies have been at odds with Indigenous stewardship, and although there have been some efforts at co-managing tribally sacred land, for example Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, this sanctuary is the first to be nominated by a tribal entity. “When land is conserved, native people are also eliminated from it,” Palumbi says. “That’s happened in pretty much every national park. There’s a strong movement to reverse that change but the damage has already been done.” The way Walker sees it, the Chumash have been stewards of the land for 15,000 years. “We welcome every culture on Chumash land,” she says. “My dad wanted people to know the Chumash like you know Hawaiians. Just as many people go to Hawaii as come here, and they don’t know about the Chumash. He wanted the sanctuary to be a way to share our stories, our culture, the beauty of our people and the magic of our homeland.”  This article was amended on 23 May 2023. An earlier version suggested that a collaboration such as that envisaged by the Chumash initiative “has yet to translate to the US mainland”. That omitted to note there have been some efforts at co-managing tribally sacred land with US government agencies, for example Bears Ears National Monument in Utah.\n",

      "Text: California governor Jerry Brown signed legislation Thursday requiring California to phase out the use of microscopic exfoliating beads in personal care products sold in the state starting in 2020 to protect fish and wildlife. The tiny plastic beads found in soap, toothpaste and body washes are so small that they are showing up in the bodies of fish and other wildlife after passing through water filtration systems without disintegrating. Assemblyman Richard Bloom, D-Santa Monica, said his bill, AB888, seeks to drastically restrict all use of the non-biodegradable beads, which can contain various toxins. “AB888 was carefully crafted to avoid any loopholes that would allow for use of potentially harmful substitutes,” Bloom said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation ensures that personal care products will be formulated with environmentally-safe alternatives to protect our waterways and oceans.” A number of companies are replacing microbeads with natural substances such as ground-up fruit pits. California lawmakers have attempted similar legislation before, but they met opposition from personal-care product companies. Amendments to the measure this year prompted many business critics to drop their opposition to California joining several other states in eliminating the so-called microbeads. The microbead ban was one of several pieces of legislation Brown signed Thursday in response to concerns about environmental degradation. He approved SB185 by Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, D-Los Angeles, which will require the state’s two large public pension funds, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, to divest from coal holdings. Brown also signed legislation giving state lawmakers two appointments to a powerful state regulatory board that has expansive authority to set regulations laying out how the state will achieve its aggressive emissions reductions target. Under AB1288, the state Legislature can appoint two members to the California Air Resources Board, expanding its size to 14. Currently, only the governor can appoint its members. And Brown announced signing legislation requiring cities and counties to create a faster process to approve new charging stations, an effort to address a patchwork of regulations throughout the state that have slowed building. His approval comes a day after he signed aggressive climate change legislation requiring California to get half its electricity from renewable energy sources within 15 years and to double the energy efficiency of existing buildings. The Democratic governor also signed three oil spill protection bills, months after a pipeline leaked more than 100,000 gallons of crude on the Santa Barbara Coast. The measures call for pipeline operators to use the best spill-control technology, require annual pipeline inspections and require regulators to notify the state Legislature if caustic chemicals are used in a cleanup. The bills were introduced after the Plains All American Pipeline ruptured underground in May, sending oil onto a beach and into the ocean. The oil spread more than 100 miles.\n",

      "Text: The head of the RSPB says the bird charity is ruling nothing out as it organises a mobilisation of millions of people against what it calls the government’s “attack on nature”. Beccy Speight dismissed accusations by Conservative MPs that the group was lying to its members and pursuing a marketing drive, as it leads a coalition campaigning against the government over key “growth” policies which it argues will damage wildlife and nature. The chief executive said a meeting with the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, Ranil Jayawardena, had not provided any reassurance that the government’s growth policies would protect nature. The director general of the National Trust, Hilary McGrady, accused the government of “demonising” conservationists, saying her members were “outraged and worried”. The RSPB made its concerns clear two weeks ago, saying: “Make no mistake we are angry.” Since then, it has joined forces with others including National Trust, Wildlife and Countryside Link, and the Wildlife Trusts to fight government policies they say will threaten protected habitats and species, put clean air, water and national wellbeing at risk, and penalise farmers who are working to protect nature. Between them, the coalition has about 15 million members. Speight said: “The response from the public has been overwhelming. I think this has really hit a nerve for people. “We are facing a really serious situation and that is why we have seen this coordinated response. This was not planned. It was an uprising of concern two weeks ago and a feeling that we need to make our voices heard in order to try to defend nature.” The concerns of the coalition focus on: The removal from the statute books of 570 laws derived from EU directives that make up the bedrock of environmental regulations in the UK, covering sewage pollution, water quality and clean air. These include the habitat regulations, which have protected areas for wildlife for more than 30 years. The ending of the moratorium on fracking. The creation of 38 low-tax investment zones from Cornwall to Cumbria where environmental protections are to be relaxed to encourage development. The feared scrapping of the post-Brexit environmental land management scheme (Elms), which pays farmers to enhance nature. The groups have been encouraging supporters to put pressure on Tory MPs over these proposals which they say strike at the heart of environmental and wildlife protections. In response, Tory MPs have criticised the RSPB, accusing it of using claims of a government attack on nature as a “marketing strategy”. Speight said: “There is clearly a generic response which MPs have been sending out. It is just not credible to suggest this is a membership drive. This is nothing to do with marketing; we have specific concerns that we have raised and we have not received assurances around any of these. “Our members are people from every political persuasion expressing their concerns and I think this shows how significant this threat is.” With little sign that the government is drawing back from the key policies of concern, Speight said the campaign would be intensified. “All options are open for what we do next. This is a really serious situation and we really need to make progress so all options are on the table. We have said that we will mobilise our membership, and we will.” Asked whether the strategy would include taking direct action, Speight said: “We are ruling nothing out.” Justifying the strong response, Speight said there was an urgency to the situation, with 41% of species in the UK in decline, and 15% at risk of extinction. “It could be really critical if they rip up these regulations. The goal in the government’s own Environment Act is to halt the decline of species by 2030. There is a huge amount of work to do to meet that goal and I wonder if the government understands how much is required to meet it. The kind of proposals that have come forward in the last two weeks suggest not,” she said. The RSPB was not mentioned in Liz Truss’s party conference speech last week, but Speight has no illusions that the charity is considered part of the “anti-growth coalition” identified by the prime minister. “We are not anti-growth,” Speight said. “But growth is not just about GDP. We think growth needs to be done better, within a healthy, natural environment which is essential if we are going to build an economy which is strong long term. “So it is about how you go about it, and the messaging we are getting so far around the growth plans doesn’t recognise any of that.”\n",

      "Text: Instead of the steaks and pork chops in our fridges, should we be investing in clean, green protein? Well, yes. Methane from livestock is responsible for 14% of global warming, and the gas is 25 times more potent than CO2. The more meat and dairy you eat from ruminants, particularly cows, the more burping and farting you are responsible for. The 2014 documentary Cowspiracy focuses on the idea that this is the great neglected greenhouse gas source. By 2050, experts predict, the demand for meat will have doubled, and meat-related emissions will boom at 12bn tonnes of carbon to feed a population of 9 billion. Our consumption has to tail off if we are to achieve Paris emissions goals. In 2013 researchers found the carbon footprint of a vegetarian to be half that of a meat eater. Comfortingly, they also found that a flexitarian approach is a close second. By replacing three-quarters of our ruminant budget with other forms of protein, we could reduce livestock emissions to 3.1bn tonnes by 2050. Chicken could play a part, but some non-meat proteins should be included, too. Not all animals are equal, ethically. Cows raised on species-rich pasture produce fewer emissions. But industrialised agriculture focuses on how to raise animals indoors in feedlots more efficiently. Low-emissions meat could have a big ethical impact in other ways. Do food retailers have a responsibility to sell less? Riverford’s “How Much Meat” campaign explores this idea. Riverford sells vegetables, so it has a vested interest, but it also sells organic meat. Apparently founder Guy Watson launched the campaign after his daughter, having seen Cowspiracy, petitioned him to divest from the  livestock industry. Fungi are known as nature’s ultimate recycler, but it is time to acknowledge the radical diversity and downright beauty of fungi, slime moulds and lichens. Botanist photographer and fungi-obsessive Steve Axford, a native of New South Wales, Australia, is on a mission to take pictures of the most obscure specimens to be found on the planet, many of which have never been catalogued before. Diamonds aren’t our best friends, ethically speaking, which is why I love the way the best new jewellery brands are redefining which materials really are precious.

      "Text: Oil tankers take a long time to turn around. The skyscraper-length ships carry so much weight and momentum that turning one 180 degrees takes at least 40 minutes even in calm seas. It is a fitting metaphor for the challenge our leaders face at the climate summit in Paris as they try to steer a new direction away from fossil fuels. Decades of dirty energy investment, the dead-weight of vested interests, shifting political tides and – let’s be honest – cheap fossil fuel prices, mean that changing the world’s entire energy system to remove the carbon causing climate change will also be a slow turnaround. Thankfully the world seems poised to chart a course for a cleaner energy future. This is not a moment too soon. If the international energy system continues on its present course, world temperatures could rise almost 3C by 2100. To avoid the consequences such a rapid climatic change could bring, global emissions need to peak and start to fall within the next few years. Campaigners will rightly point out this week that the commitments agreed in Paris do not add up to enough to avoid the dangerous 2C threshold. A legally binding agreement to rapidly and fairly reduce emissions – reflecting what the science tells us we need to do to avoid disaster – would be the perfect outcome. But that is simply not politically possible at the moment and we must not let the best, become the enemy of the good. We should not give up on the goal of a legal cap on global emissions that keeps us below 2C. But right now we just need to get things moving in the right direction. The UN has done a good job of getting countries on board with the looser idea of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions and I am hopeful that the deal reached next week will be a reasonably good one. But Paris is only the beginning of a slow transition from a fossil-fuelled world to one powered by clean technology. Implementing the pledges made in Paris will be crucial. To get that tanker turning we need a clear steer from governments. Our own included. That means strong and consistent policy. Governments in the UK have had a good record on climate leadership. The UK introduced the world’s first legally binding carbon budgets, the Scottish government set a target to go 100% renewable, and the present government’s recent ‘energy policy reset’ set a date to close the last of our polluting coal plants. The ‘reset’, however, does not provide the clear steer we need beyond Paris. The energy secretary, Amber Rudd envisages a new fleet of gas power stations to replace coal. Gas pumps out half the emissions of coal, at roughly 450 g CO2 per kilowatt hour (KWh), so this will deliver some savings in the short term. But these new power stations will last for decades and can only be consistent with our climate change targets if their emissions can be brought down to under 100g CO2 per KWh by the 2030s. That can only be achieved if technology is developed to capture and store the carbon pollution they produce. However, the energy department has pulled the plug on funding for a £1bn government competition to develop carbon capture and storage (CCS) pilot projects. It was 10 years in the making, with companies only weeks away from submitting final entries. This latest policy reversal comes at a time when the energy industry’s trust in the government was already sinking. Since coming to power the government has also scrapped subsidies for renewables and ended the green deal for energy efficiency and planned regulation on zero carbon homes. This is extraordinarily short-sighted. Onshore wind farms and solar power are rapidly approaching cost parity with other forms of power, but they still need support. And the best way to cut carbon, while also reducing bills and enhancing our energy security, is to build energy efficient homes and businesses. This would save us all money and reduce the need for new gas power stations. Getting a good deal in the next two weeks is essential, but it represents only the first turn of the tanker’s wheel. A clear and consistent steer from government is crucial to instil the confidence needed for the big investment decisions before the end of this decade to meet our carbon budgets. If the government locks us into 20th century fossil fuel technology now, we may be forced to make a more expensive emergency turnaround later. The Kyoto protocol sank after it was agreed because governments did not commit to it, we must not let the same fate befall Paris. The move towards a sustainable energy system shouldn’t be seen as a cost to be avoided, but as an opportunity to innovate, create jobs and enrich our economy. We should join the rest of the world in charting a course for a clean energy future.\n",

      "Text: Ministers missed out on tens of millions extra on the sale of the Green Investment Bank (GIB) in August, according to the spending watchdog. The National Audit Office said the £1.6bn paid in cash by the Australian bank Macquarie came in at the low end of the government’s valuation. Macquarie agreed to spend a further £500m to cover the bank’s existing commitments. Moreover, the government could have increased the value of the sale by £63m if it had waited until some of the windfarms owned by the bank had finished construction. One option under consideration was a phased sale, where the government retained ownership of the bank until 2018 when most of its investments were operational and then privatised it through an initial public offering. “It was likely that assets would have been worth more if it waited for a sale,” the spending watchdog said in a report on whether ministers achieved value for money on the sale. However, it added that ministers had avoided construction risks by selling when they did. Caroline Lucas, the Green party co-leader, said: “It’s simply shocking that the government wasted millions of pounds by not going ahead with the phased sale option.” The bank was a centrepiece of the coalition government’s efforts to kickstart the green economy. It invested £12bn of public and private capital in offshore windfarms, waste-to-energy plants and energy-saving projects, but, three years after it was launched, ministers said it would be sold to pay off public debt. Even though the decision was made to sell as soon as possible rather than wait until 2018, the process still took longer than expected, with negative effects on the bank. Delays stemming from legislative scrutiny, haggling over the price and legal challenges led the transaction to take more than 17 months – more than twice as long as expected. The delay hit day-to-day operations as key staff fled the bank and contributed to the cost of government legal fees, that more than doubledto £2.36m. “GIB told us the delay and uncertainty throughout the sale process led to the loss of key GIB staff, and affected GIB’s ability to continue investing in projects,” the NAO said. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader and the minister who launched the bank, said the decision to privatise the institution showed the Conservatives did not care about the environment. “Sadly, the mishandled sale process has created uncertainty, particularly through key staff losses, at a time when the GIB should have been growing and helping the UK hit international carbon reduction targets by fostering the green economy,” he said. The National Audit Office said that while officials had secured some commitments from Macquarie to continue its green goals, they were not legally binding. Labour MP Meg Hillier, chair of the public accounts committee of MPs, said she was “deeply disappointed” at the guarantees the government had won on the green objectives. The NAO report laid bare the lack of serious competition in the bidding process, particularly after a member withdrew in September 2016 from Macquarie’s main rival, the SDCL consortium. “The Macquarie consortium became aware of this, and saw itself as the only credible bidder left in the process. This led to a loss of competitive tension in the sale process,” the report said. The NAO also noted that the drawn-out completion process effectively meant the government lost a further £14.5m on the sale on top of the £63m. The government defended selling when it did, saying it offered a higher degree of certainty and shifted risks to Macquarie. “The sale of the Green Investment Bank made £186m profit for the taxpayer. The UK led the world in setting up the GIB to drive investment in renewable technology,” the UK government said. Edward Northam, the head of the Green Investment Group, Europe, said: “We’ve made very positive initial progress and look forward to lots more to come, delivering pioneering green investment in the UK and internationally.”\n",

      "Text: Electronic product life spans are getting shorter, an investigation of built-in obsolescence for the German environment agency has indicated. But consumers’ desire to replace products such as flat-screen TVs with newer model is also a major factor in what the research identified as increasingly wasteful consumption of electronic goods. The environment agency asked Öko-Institut researchers to examine consumers’ reasons for replacing electrical and electronic appliances with a view to establishing whether manufacturers are purposefully shortening product life spans to prop up sales, a phenomenon known as built-in obsolescence. The researchers did not draw a firm conclusion on built-in obsolescence but noted that the proportion of all units sold to replace a defective appliance grew from 3.5% in 2004 to 8.3% in 2012, in what they deemed a “remarkable” increase. And the share of large household appliances that had to be replaced within the first five years of use grew from 7% of total replacements in 2004 to 13% in 2013. This too was largely due to an increase in the proportion of recently purchased appliances replaced following a defect, which may point to an obsolescence problem. However consumer preference is also playing a role. A third of all replacement purchases for products such as refrigerators and washing machines were motivated by a desire for a better unit while the old one was still functioning. Consumers are also increasingly keen to swap their flat screen televisions for better versions with larger screens and better picture quality, even though more than 60% of replaced televisions were still functioning in 2012. Policymakers are increasingly concerned about inefficient use of resources in resource-poor Europe, and about the environmental impact of this. The EU is looking to regulate product resource efficiency by including new standards such as durability and repairability in requirements under the Ecodesign Directive, a law that is currently focused on energy efficiency for the most part. For laptops, the desire to upgrade a functioning device seems to have lessened over the study period, the researchers said. They could not point to clear evidence that laptops now break sooner than before but they noted that a quarter of recent replacements were due to a defect. The study is the first phase of a larger research project by the German environment agency aimed at identifying ways of increasing product life spans.\n",

      "Text: A key United Nations biodiversity summit has been delayed for a third time due to the pandemic, the Chinese environment ministry has announced, as environmentalists pledged the delay would “not mean taking our foot off the pedal”. In a statement, the Chinese ministry of ecology and environment confirmed that Cop15, the biggest biodiversity summit in a decade, would be delayed, and that negotiations for this decade’s targets will be split into two phases so that governments can meet face-to-face in Kunming, China, in the first half of 2022. The talks had been scheduled for October this year after two previous delays due to the coronavirus pandemic. The first phase of the meeting, which will be largely procedural, will be held in the Chinese city between 11 and 15 October, with most people attending virtually. Countries will then negotiate the targets for the global biodiversity framework that governments will aim to meet by the end of the decade in Kunming from 25 April to 8 May 2022. The draft text of the framework includes proposals to reduce pesticide use by two-thirds, eliminate plastic pollution and protect 30% of the Earth’s land and sea. In a statement, the Chinese environment ministry said it would continue to work with the UN to overcome the impact of the pandemic and fulfil its obligations as a host country. Li Shuo, a policy adviser for Greenpeace China who has been following the biodiversity negotiations closely, said: “Given the urgency of the biodiversity crisis, the decision to delay talks is not ideal. But in light of the global pandemic and the need for face-to-face negotiations, it is an inevitable choice. “Today’s decision does not mean a negotiation holiday. In light of the flaws in the recently released first draft, much work still needs to be done to address the implementation and support deficit in the CBD. “The partial convening of Cop15 in October must demonstrate ambitious leadership. It should be a high level opportunity to provide real impetus to the Kunming process. “China needs to understand that much of the responsibilities for the success of Cop15 are on its shoulder now. It needs to rise up, otherwise the global nature protection agenda will fall.” Zac Goldsmith, Britain’s minister for the environment, said: “We need to tackle the biodiversity crisis head on, and this delay will not mean taking our foot off the pedal. As president of the recent G7, we are encouraged to see major progress on finance for nature, on cleaning up global supply chains, on efforts to tackle deforestation and with the global commitment to protect 30% of the world’s land and ocean by 2030. The upcoming G20 meeting gives us a chance to build on that momentum ahead of Cop26 later this year. We will continue to press countries to join us in ramping up efforts to protect and restore nature.” Brian O’Donnell, director of Campaign for Nature, said: “It is critically important for all parties and civil society to equitably participate in the development of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, and we must stand in solidarity with all people battling the Covid-19 pandemic worldwide. There is no pause button for biodiversity loss. Human destruction of nature continues unabated, and governments do not need to wait for a global deal to take action and redirect finance to urgently protect our planet.” Beccy Speight, chief executive of the RSPB, said the delay was understandable but the crisis in the natural world had not been put on hold. In November, the UK will host the UN Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow. Speight said: “Our leaders must take this opportunity for the UK to live up to our ambition to show global leadership on the environment … and use this time to start to put the words and commitments of the Leaders’ Pledge for Nature into domestic action. This will send a powerful message to the international community that our words are being backed by urgent action to revive our world with clear, legally binding targets to halt and reverse the wildlife decline in the UK by 2030.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features\n",

      "Text: The government has delayed by a year its scheme for spurring the take-up of heat pumps, under pressure from the gas boiler industry. The clean heat market mechanism is intended to force heating installers to fit more low-carbon heat pumps, to meet the UK’s net zero greenhouse gas emissions target and save energy. But the scheme – which requires companies to install a gradually increasing proportion of heat pumps compared with the number of gas boiler installations or face a financial penalty – was inaccurately described as a “boiler tax” by gas heating companies and their lobbyists. Some boiler companies put their prices up by £120, which they said was in reaction to the potential scheme, but which one government insider told the Guardian was unfair price “gouging”. The mechanism was due to come in this April but has been delayed to April 2025, the government said on Thursday. The energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, has also asked the Competition and Markets Authority to investigate the boiler market. Reforms to the boiler upgrade scheme also announced on Thursday will mean households no longer need to upgrade their insulation to take advantage of government heat pump grants. Removing the requirement for cavity wall and loft insulation should save consumers about £2,500 on a heat pump installation, for which the government is offering a £7,500 grant. Heat pumps can cost up to £14,000, but cheaper models are rapidly coming on to the market. Radiators generally run at lower temperatures with heat pumps than with boilers, so homeowners are encouraged to have insulation fitted too, which also reduces emissions, but increases the cost of installation. Coutinho, who earlier this week called for new gas-fired power generation, said: “We’ve already supported families by making our boiler upgrade scheme one of the most generous in Europe, and now we’re making heat pumps even cheaper and easier to install. This is all part of our wider plan to ensure we cut our emissions and make homes more energy efficient without burdening families with high costs.” Juliet Phillips, an analyst at the E3G thinktank, welcomed aspects of the strategy but urged the government to move faster. “The government must move ahead with laying the legislation as soon as possible – without this, there will be continued speculation that the mechanism has been quietly killed,” she said. David Cowdrey, director of external affairs at the MCS Foundation, a charity that works on low-carbon homes, said: “It is extremely disappointing to see that the government has postponed one of the most important policies for getting the UK off fossil fuel heating. The clean heat market mechanism is crucial to the rollout of heat pumps, which are the only viable option to decarbonising at scale the 17% of UK emissions that are created by heating our homes.” He added: “The government needs to immediately set out plans for how it intends to fill the huge gap in heat pump plans that they have just created. We need clear and consistent policy more than anything, and without that the UK’s target of installing 600,000 heat pumps a year by 2028 is in serious jeopardy.”\n",

      "Text: Hydrogen is the smallest, lightest and most abundant molecule in the universe. On Earth, it does not occur by itself naturally, but can be separated from water (H2O) or hydrocarbon compounds (fossil fuels) like gas, coal and petroleum to be used as an energy source. It’s already used for rocket fuel, but it is now being pushed as a clean and safe alternative to oil and gas for heating and earthly modes of transport. Political support is mounting with almost $26bn of US taxpayer money available for hydrogen projects thanks to three recent laws – the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and the Chips Act. Hydrogen is politically hot, but is it the climate solution that its cheerleaders are claiming? The short answer is that the fossil fuel industry sees hydrogen as a way to keep on drilling and building new infrastructure. Friends of the Earth has tracked how the industry has successfully deployed its PR and lobbying machines over recent years to get policymakers thinking that hydrogen is a catch-all climate solution. Research by climate scientists (without fossil fuel links) has debunked industry claims that hydrogen should be a major player in our decarbonised future, though hydrogen extracted from water (using renewable energy sources) could – and should – play an important role in replacing the dirtiest hydrogen currently extracted from fossil fuels. It may also have a role in fuelling some transportation like long-haul flights and vintage cars, but the evidence is far from clear. However, with billions of climate action dollars up for grabs in the US alone, expect to see more lobbying, more industry-funded evidence and more hype. Extracting hydrogen is energy intensive, so the source and how it’s done both matter. Currently, about 96% of the world’s hydrogen comes from coal (brown) and gas (grey), with the rest created from nuclear (pink) and renewable sources like hydro, wind and solar. Production of both grey and brown hydrogen release carbon dioxide (CO2) and unburnt fugitive methane into the atmosphere. This super-polluting hydrogen is what’s currently used as the chemical base for synthetic nitrogen fertilisers, plastics and steel among other industries. Blue hydrogen is what the fossil fuel industry is most invested in, as it still comes from gas but ostensibly the CO2 would be captured and stored underground. The industry claims to have the technology to capture 80-90% of CO2, but in reality, it’s closer to 12% when every stage of the energy-intensive process is evaluated, according to a peer-reviewed study by scientists at Cornell University published in 2021. For sure better than nothing, but methane emissions, which warm the planet faster than CO2, would actually be higher than for grey hydrogen because of the additional gas needed to power the carbon capture, and likely upstream leakage. Notably, the term clean hydrogen was coined by the fossil fuel industry a few months after the seminal Cornell study found that blue hydrogen has a substantially larger greenhouse gas footprint than burning gas, coal or diesel oil for heating. Green hydrogen is extracted from water by electrolysis – using electricity generated by renewable energy sources (wind, solar, hydro). Climate experts (without links to fossil fuels) say green hydrogen can only be green if new renewable sources are constructed to power hydrogen production – rather than drawing on the current grid and questionable carbon accounting schemes. The industry disagrees: “Strict additionality rules requiring electrolytic hydrogen to be powered by new renewable energy is not practical, especially in the early years, and will severely limit the development of hydrogen projects,” said BP America. “There may be some small role in truly green hydrogen in a decarbonised future, but this is largely a marketing creation by the oil and gas industry that has been hugely overhyped,” said Robert Howarth, professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, a co-author of the paper on blue hydrogen. In addition to $26bn in direct financing for so-called hydrogen hubs and demo projects, another $100bn or so in uncapped tax credits could be paid out over the next few decades, so lots and lots of taxpayers’ money. Fossil fuel companies are also using hydrogen to justify building more pipelines, claiming that this infrastructure can be used for “clean hydrogen” in the future. But hydrogen is a highly flammable and corrosive element, and it would be costly to repurpose oil and gas infrastructure to make it safe for hydrogen. And while hydrogen is not a greenhouse gas, it is not harmless. It aggravates some greenhouse gases, for instance causing methane to stay in the atmosphere for longer. “This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in actual zero-emission solutions, but could be a disaster if the federal government pours scarce resources into infrastructure and technologies that could make the climate crisis worse and cause further public health harms,” said Sara Gersen, clean energy attorney at Earthjustice. “Sowing confusion about hydrogen is a delay tactic, and delay is the new denialism.” Yes, but a limited one – given that it takes more energy to produce, store and transport hydrogen than it provides when converted into useful energy, so using anything but new renewable sources (true green hydrogen) will require burning more fossil fuels. According to the hydrogen merit ladder devised by Michael Liebreich, host of the Cleaning Up podcast, swapping clean hydrogen for the fossil fuel-based grey and brown stuff currently used for synthetic fertilisers, petrochemicals and steel is a no-brainer. The carbon footprint of global hydrogen production today is equivalent to Germany’s annual greenhouse gas emissions, so the sooner we swap to green hydrogen (created from new renewables) the better. This could also be useful for some transportation, such as long-haul flights and heavy machinery, and maybe to store surplus wind and solar energy – though none are slam dunks for hydrogen as there are alternative technologies vying for these markets, said Liebreich. But for most forms of transport (cars, bikes, buses and trains) and heating there are already safer, cleaner and cheaper technologies such as battery-run electric vehicles and heat pumps, so there’s little or no merit in investing time or money with hydrogen. Howarth said: “Renewable electricity is a scarce resource. Direct electrification and batteries offer so much more, and much more quickly. It’s a huge distraction and waste of resources to even be talking about heating homes and passenger vehicles with hydrogen.”\n",

      "Text: The world’s leading energy economist has warned against investing in large new oil and gas developments, which would have little impact on the current energy crisis and soaring fuel prices but spell devastation to the planet. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), was responding to an investigation in the Guardian that revealed fossil fuel companies were planning huge “carbon bomb” projects that would drive climate catastrophe. He said countries must seek to replace Russian oil and gas in the near term without damaging their long-term prospects. “I understand some countries may look at new fossil fuels but they should remember it takes many years to start production,” he said. “[Such projects] are not the solution to our urgent energy security needs and they will lock in fossil fuel use.” Revelations by the Guardian show nearly 200 carbon bomb projects are in planning, or have already started pumping, that will each result in at least 1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions over their lifetimes, equivalent to about 18 years of current global emissions. Companies pursuing such developments could end up with uneconomic stranded assets, Birol warned. “If the world is to succeed in moving to net zero, these projects may fail to recover their upfront development costs,” he said in an interview with the Guaridan. Soaring global energy prices have led governments to seek new sources of fossil fuels. “I do understand why countries are reacting like this,” he said. “But there is the issue of the time horizon.” Big new exploratory projects for oil, gas and coal would take years to produce any fuel and could lock in high greenhouse gas emissions for decades, Birol warned. “The most suitable projects are those with short lead times and quick payback periods, such as expanding production from existing fields,” he said. Using existing sources more efficiently would also help reduce emissions, Birol noted. He said governments must also urgently seek to reduce fossil fuel demand, through home insulation, cutting speed limits, making public transport cheap or free and introducing car-free days in cities. “If we do not have these voluntary measures, I’m afraid that energy rationing may be on the table,” he said. Birol said unlike in previous oil shocks, such as those of the 1970s, the world now had cheap alternatives available in the form of solar and wind power, which had plummeted in price. This should prompt governments and companies to push harder for renewable energy. “I believe we have the chance to make this a historic turning point to a cleaner and more secure energy system,” he said. “This is the first time I have seen such momentum behind the change to clean energy. “The world does not need to choose between solving the energy crisis and climate crisis, we can do both.” The UN secretary general also called for an end to new fossil fuel projects, warning that climate change posed “an existential threat to us all – to the whole world”. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, António Guterres said: “Main emitters must drastically cut emissions, starting now. This means accelerating the end of our fossil fuel addiction and speeding up the deployment of clean renewable energy.” The IEA advised almost exactly a year ago that no new gas, oil or coal development could take place from this year onwards if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C. That finding caused shockwaves among governments in the run-up to the UN Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November, where leaders agreed to bring forward national plans in line with the 1.5C limit. But many countries, and private sector companies, have ignored the advice, as the Guardian’s investigation of fossil fuel projects under development has shown. These carbon bombs would in effect eliminate any hope of staying within the 1.5C threshold. Greg Muttitt, an energy expert at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, said: “Governments and companies often suffer from a form of cognitive dissonance: while recognising the urgency and severity of the climate threat, they still keep developing new oil, gas and coalfields and mines that will worsen the problem. The policy answer is a simple one: when in a hole, you need to stop digging.” Greenpeace said the Guardian’s investigation revealed the “fossil fuel industry’s business model remains a blueprint for climate catastrophe”. “Investment plans by oil and gas firms will blow us past every assessment of what is safe for the climate, and that’s shocking,” said the group’s senior climate adviser Charlie Kronick. “But what’s truly shocking is that they are not hiding it. These activities are legal and in fact are encouraged by governments around the world, particularly the ones that have the biggest reserves and the most to lose.” Caroline Lucas, an MP for the UK’s Green party, said in response to the Guardian’s investigation: “Governments seem intent on sending us towards our own destruction. How many more times must we tell fossil fuel companies to #keepitintheground?” Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change and net zero secretary, said: “The answer to a global fossil fuel crisis cannot be to double down on fossil fuels. Every country must go further to rapidly accelerate the transition to clean energy. “That’s the right response to the climate crisis, but it’s also the right response to the cost of living and energy security crises too – with renewables now by far the cheapest and most secure form of energy. “Governments around the world should be urgently investing in a green energy sprint to shift decisively off destructive, expensive, and volatile fossil fuels for good.”\n",

      "Text: Threatened wildlife including turtle doves and skylarks could benefit from a scheme which has been launched to create natural habitats at solar farm sites. The project by wildlife charity RSPB and clean tech company Anesco aims to boost wildlife at the firm’s solar farms across England and Wales. Wild flower meadow areas and seed-rich planting in the “unused” margins of the farms and where tracks go between the panels will help boost insects such as bees and butterflies and provide food and nesting areas for birds, the RSPB said. The scheme will reinstate habitats which have been lost in the face of agricultural intensification, hitting farmland bird species. It is hoped that struggling species such as tree sparrows, which have seen numbers fall by 94% in the last 40 years, turtle doves which have seen an 89% reduction in numbers, lapwing (58% fall) and skylarks (51% fall) will be helped by the project. Butterflies, reptiles, mammals and amphibians could also be helped by the move. The project will see the RSPB advising Anesco on providing for “priority” species - those in most need of help - at its existing solar farms, in places ranging from Cornwall to Suffolk, Yorkshire and the Isle of Anglesey, with the advice also helping to form plans at new sites. Darren Moorcroft, RSPB head of species and habitats conservation, said: “It is an excellent opportunity to develop habitats for nature in need of our help, showcasing how a renewable energy business and wildlife conservation can be delivered in unison; whilst providing clean energy and sustainable development we can still continue to give nature a home.” He added: “We’re interested in renewable energy because the threat of climate change is the biggest threat to nature and to people. “The opportunity of this partnership is both mitigation and adaptation. The panels are helping us to reduce our carbon emissions and the habitat within the solar farms can create the places for priority species to live and survive and thrive.” Adrian Pike, chief executive of Anesco, said: “Encouraging biodiversity has always been a priority for us and we’re thrilled to be working with such a respected and knowledgeable organisation as the RSPB to build on our existing commitment. “We will be maximising the positive impact that our sites have for local wildlife, while focusing on supporting those species that really need it.”\n",

      "Text: The Queensland senator Glenn Lazarus says he hopes a Senate inquiry into unconventional gas mining will restart political momentum around a push for farmer land rights which has waned in the months since the death of activist George Bender. Lazarus has dubbed the Senate investigation the “Bender inquiry”, in honour of the Queensland farmer whose suicide last October after a 10-year battle with gas companies put the issue on the national agenda. The deputy prime minister, Warren Truss, was among the federal government figures who subsequently said they supported farmers’ rights to veto coal seam gas exploration and extraction on their properties. But legislative changes were in the hands of state governments, a spokesman for Truss said at the time. Lazarus said the issue had since fallen by the wayside, despite him meeting to discuss it several times with the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull. “Some politicians from the major parties did voice concerns but nothing’s been done,” he said. “The real frustrating thing is that while it was topical, they all said the right things. But of course people have got on with their lives and the George Bender issue is months old and doesn’t get a mention anywhere. “So I’m hoping this inquiry will bring those issues back to the forefront and we can get some strategies or something in place where the farmer has rights and that we’re not completely stuffing up the environment.” Lazarus is an unlikely crusader who has amplified his attempts to raise the need for scrutiny of the resources industry after deserting the political party founded by the mining entrepreneur Clive Palmer last July. The independent senator said he was proud to have been able to mount a Senate inquiry to give a platform to people who felt they were being ignored by the political establishment. “I tell you what, it took a lot of hard work because both major parties really didn’t want anything to do with it,” he said. “But I think through public pressure, it certainly helps and we got it up.” Lazarus said he was struck by the weight of anecdotal evidence to date from farmers about the duplicity of some gas companies in their dealings across Queensland’s gasfields. Bores running dry and animals being born blind are among the alleged impacts of gas drilling he has encountered during regular visits to the western downs since last year. He cited shale gas in the Northern Territory and tight gas in Western Australia as the emerging frontiers of the issue. A Queensland government report showed production of coal seam gas in 2014-15 at 457 petajoules was more than 10 times the amount of conventional gas. The report said exploration for shale gas and tight gas in Queensland – the latter of which may be found in “significant” quantities – was “only just beginning”. Lazarus said the “unfettered” rights of gas companies to use scarce water resources and the risk that contaminated water posed to the beef industry were key concerns. “The mining companies will tell you this is all bullshit and they look after [landholders] really well,” he said. “But at the end of the day, there’s too many people that have come to me and told me they are living in horrendous conditions and are really worried. “I’ve seen pictures where people who are not living far out of towns like Dalby have to have water shipped in on a pallet because they don’t have any fresh water. “[The companies] tell you it’s not affecting anything. The issue for me is either they don’t know what they’re doing or they do know and they’re deliberately denying it.” Lazarus called for more funding for an independent testing regime for environmental impacts of gas extraction and more scrutiny of gas company operations in remote areas. Any future discovery of contamination of livestock through the spread of water polluted with fracking chemicals in paddocks and waterways could bring the meat industry to its knees, he said. “One of the things that doesn’t get spoken about is a lot of the cattle farmers are under an immense amount of scrutiny when it comes to their meat,” he said. “That meat is tested on a regular basis and, I have to say, if one of them gets caught out, it’ll pretty much close them down.” Lazarus denied the inquiry would represent a “witch hunt” of gas companies but would shed light on the environmental and financial impacts of the industry, from royalty regimes to compensation payments. “I’ve met people whose land was pretty much unworkable and they’ve got CSG wells and they’re really happy,” he said. “So we need to hear all the facts, good and bad.” Lazarus will chair the select committee running the inquiry, which will also include the Greens senator Larissa Waters, the Liberal National party senators Matthew Canavan and Joanna Lindgren and Labor senators Joe Ludwig and Anne McEwen. Submissions close on 14 March, with hearings likely to begin in Dalby next month.\n",

      "Text: The economic rescue packages to deal with the impact of the coronavirus must also be green, a growing chorus of environmental campaigners have urged, concerned that hasty measures will lock the world into a high-carbon future. “Governments need to put huge amounts of money into trying to sustain jobs and livelihoods,” said Mary Robinson, a former Irish president and UN high commissioner for human rights, who served twice as UN climate envoy. “But they must do it with a very strong green emphasis. The threat from climate change is as real as the threat from Covid-19, though it seems far away.” “Money has poured into the fossil fuel industry since the Paris agreement [of 2015],” she said. “That can’t continue.” But she said the changes wrought in societies around the world by dealing with Covid-19 would also demonstrate to people that the changes needed to achieve a low-carbon future were much less drastic and far more palatable. As far as the climate was concerned, “we must not go back to bad habits afterwards”, she said. “It will be easier to persuade people, as we have had to change so dramatically because of this threat.” Economic plans worth trillions of dollars in public money are being rolled out to stave off the immediate collapse of some badly hit businesses, such as airlines and tourism – and to protect the incomes of workers in danger of redundancy as normal life becomes impossible across Europe and large parts of the US, as it already has in many parts of east Asia. But while people’s health and the immediate welfare of workers caught up in the crisis are paramount, campaigners and experts fear that if the longer-term packages are not carefully designed they will only entrench fossil fuel dependence across the global economy. “Governments are drawing up stimulus plans to counter the economic damage from coronavirus,” said Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency. “These stimulus packages offer an excellent opportunity to ensure that the essential task of building a secure and sustainable energy future doesn’t get lost amid the flurry of immediate priorities.” The Bank of England is resuming its quantitative easing programme of buying up assets to create liquidity in the financial system, as it did after the 2008 crash, but there are concerns that the programme has previously been used to buy bonds from fossil fuel companies including Shell, BP and Total. There have been calls in some areas, such as eastern Europe and in Asia, to ignore climate concerns and pour stimulus money into existing high-carbon businesses and fossil fuels, rather than seeking a balance with a longer-term view that includes the need to curb emissions. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said governments must act urgently to protect people’s livelihoods, which could be done without directing the money to prop up ailing sectors whose long-term future was already threatened by the climate crisis. “Decisions are being made now about whether to spend billions rescuing airlines, cruise ships, the oil and gas industry, among many others,” he said. “Bailing out the shareholders of dirty industries to continue businessasusual rather than protecting workers and their families means we would have learnt nothing from the bank bailout during the financial crisis.” Green campaigners have long talked about a “just transition” that would enable workers to move away from fossil fuel-dependent jobs and into skilled jobs with long-term low-carbon prospects. They argue this is compatible with tackling the coronavirus, too – but only if governments resist calls to downgrade environmental aims in light of the new crisis. “Diluting or doing away with environmental regulations to get a quick economic hit, as China and Poland are suggesting, would be misplaced – out of the frying pan, into the fire, even if the fire seems a few years away,” said Shaun Spiers, the executive director of the Green Alliance thinktank. “It is striking that the ruling party in South Korea has not let coronavirus deter it from proposing a green new deal election manifesto. But I would expect the UK to prioritise the immediate economic impact while also applying a climate lens and thinking about the longer term.” In the US, campaigners are concerned that Donald Trump’s hostility to climate science and wooing of fossil fuel industries will skew the economic rescue packages in harmful ways. The planned bailout for airlines and the cruise industry’s request for cash are an immediate worry. “Given that airlines produce a very large and growing amount of climate pollution, any financial assistance should include requirements that these companies take action to reduce their emissions,” said Annie Petsonk of the US-based Environmental Defense Fund. “The cruise industry, which has also requested billions in aid, has serious environmental impacts as well, and should meet new standards in exchange for government funding.” She said that in return for public money, companies should give firm commitments on carbon. “[That] would be a major step in the fight against climate change. Taxpayers, many of whom are now struggling financially, have the right to expect responsible behaviour in exchange for bailouts. They should not be funding private businesses only to see them create more costs for the public – in the form of climate impacts – in the future.” For many experts, the vital point is that the lessons from the stimulus following the financial crisis more than a decade ago are learned. Then, as now, global greenhouse gas emissions paused as the crisis hit. But after the immediate impact, emissions began their steady rise again and have continued to do so since, partly because the chance was missed to use the vast amounts of public money to set the world on a green path. “Given the state will never again play such a powerful role in our economy, and more broadly the global economy, if there was ever a time to join the dots between responding to the health emergency and the climate and nature emergency then this is it,” said Sauven. “The worst case would be that you haven’t used this awful crisis to reorientate the economy to achieve a much better outcome for people and the environment globally.”\n",

      "Text: Mining company Glencore could be forced to only sell coal from a new mine in New South Wales to signatories of the Paris climate agreement, under a proposal floated by the state’s independent planning commission. Opposed by Glencore and its joint-venture partner in the mine, Peabody, the condition would see approval of the Wambo open-cut coalmine in the state’s Hunter Valley linked to the countries it exports to. But the proposal has prompted a mixed response from environment groups. While some have argued linking the coal mine’s approval to global emissions is positive, others say merely restricting exports to signatories to the Paris agreement will not have any meaningful impact because virtually every country has signed up to the agreement. In a statement, the NSW independent planning commission said it was considering approving the mine under the condition Glencore prepared an export management plan showing how it would “use its best endeavours” to ensure any coal extracted from the mine only be exported to signatories to the Paris deal, or to countries that have similar policies in place aimed at minimising greenhouse gas emissions. The purpose of the condition, the commission said, “is to ensure that all practicable measures are adopted by the applicant to minimise greenhouse gas emissions”. The proposal document circulated by the planning commission fails to distinguish between signatories to the Paris agreement and those that have actually ratified it; when it was negotiated in 2015 the Paris accord was signed by 195 countries covering most of the Earth’s greenhouse emissions. While the Lock the Gate Alliance said the group supported the proposal, the Environment Defenders Officer said the proposal was “flawed” because it assumed countries which had ratified the Paris agreement would meet climate abatement targets; under current commitments, the world is on track for more than 3C of global heating, well beyond what was promised in the Paris agreement. The EDO’s chief executive, David Morris, said the group was considering the “legal validity” of the condition, but that it was flawed because it was underpinned by “two factual inaccuracies”. “Many countries that have signed the Paris Agreement, on current trajectories, will fail to achieve their existing commitments,” he said. “Even if all signatories did meet their existing commitments, the world will warm far more than the goal set in Paris to limit the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees. “That is, despite the fact that most countries are signatories to, and have ratified, the Paris Agreement, there remains a huge disconnect between countries’ Paris Commitments and achieving the Goals of the Paris Agreement.  “Also, given that the vast majority of countries have either signed or ratified the Paris Agreement, the proposed condition will do very little to change the business as usual approach to the mitigation of emissions from coal exports.” Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The planning commission’s proposal comes seven months after the chief judge of the state’s land and environment court, Brian Preston, dismissed an appeal by mining company Gloucester Resources over the controversial Rocky Hill open-cut coking coal mine 5km outside of the town of Gloucester in the state’s Hunter Valley, in part because of its impact on climate change. While that decision did not set a legal precedent, Georgina Woods from the Lock the Gate Alliance said the decision had “opened the door” for the commission to consider the global emission implications of an approval on a coalmine. “I think that basically the commission has been grappling with what it can and should do in the wake of Rocky Hill and this is them trying to find a position on what is in their power to do,” she said. “I think it’s positive that, rather than the commission taking at face value what Glencore is saying about its impact on emissions, it’s actually making that a legal requirement of its approval. “The condition they have proposed does need augmenting to recognise that simply being a member of the Paris agreement doesn’t in and of itself achieve what the commission is seeking to achieve, but it is significant because it is the first time ever that the approval of a mine in NSW would be tied to the global effort to reduce global greenhouse emissions.” Woods said that if Glencore was forced to develop an export management plan, it should be “dynamic”. “What we will be arguing is that the management plan needs to have an annual review plan. The Paris agreement is an instrument that recognises mitigation needs to be dynamic and something that increases over time. The commitments are not static so neither can any emissions management.” Glencore and Peabody argue that the condition should not be imposed because the most likely buyers of the coal were already Paris signatories. In a lengthy submission, it also argued against linking the mine with emissions from coal exported to a foreign country, as proposed by environment groups in the wake of the Gloucester decision. The buyers, the companies argued, were “ultimately responsible” for emissions. “[E]missions generated by the combustion of the project’s coal should not outweigh the significant social and economic benefits that the project will deliver at a local, regional and state level,” it said in a submission to the commission.\n",

      "Text: People living in regional areas are at risk of becoming the “last people in the world” left driving petrol cars because incentives for electric vehicles have been targeted towards city drivers. Most EVs on the market are likely to have the battery range needed for those living long distances from urban centres, however Australian policy is currently geared only towards encouraging uptake among citydwellers, new research from the Australian National University has found. This could leave remote Australians exposed to ever-rising prices for fossil fuels. Though Australia has historically been slow to embrace electric vehicles, state and territory governments have introduced a range of incentives to encourage the transition over the past few years. Most of these policies however have been focused on city drivers thanks to a widespread assumption that the limited range on electric vehicles makes them unsuitable for regional areas. The ANU research has turned that assumption on its head by investigating whether electric car drivers in regional areas could make the journey to major service hubs in one trip. In the analysis, researchers considered the Tesla Model S and the Audi e-tron 50 Quattro as both were 4WD vehicles already available on the Australian market with larger battery ranges. They did not account for variables such as topography, sealed or unsealed roads and extreme heat which all may influence battery life. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The result was nine out of every 10 people living in regional Australia were within range of the nearest service hub and would be able to make a one-way trip without having to stop to charge. With the right infrastructure installed at the destination, like fast chargers, most could charge their vehicle and easily make a return trip. Dr Bjorn Sturmberg, research lead at the ANU Battery Storage and Grid Integration Program and co-author on the study says the result shows the tyranny of distance is not as much of an issue as previously thought in Australia. “It means greater resilience, much lower cost of electricity supply, lower cost of transport and then potential benefit of more reliable supply,” Sturmberg said. Where solar rigs were installed at the point of origin in order to charge the cars, and to power-charging infrastructure along routes for the most remote locations, the benefits of electric vehicles were multiplied. “The running costs of an electric vehicle are very cheap, irrespective of where you fill it up. If you fill it up with solar, then the running costs – not counting the cost of getting solar installed out there – is near to zero,” Sturmberg said. With the number of service stations having declined from 20,000 in the 1970s to 6,400 today, this would also boost energy security, especially among communities that have to ship or truck in supplies of diesel. Sturmberg said the research highlights a blindspot among policymakers who have largely been focused on bringing electric vehicles to urban areas when the potential gains for regional people, including remote Indigenous communities are significant. “Their reliance on fossil fuels for transport leaves them vulnerable in an economic sense. It’s always been expensive in the economic sense and especially now when fuel prices continue to skyrocket,” he said. “I feel like they’ve been left in the too hard basket where everyone assumes the distances are too great. [If this continues] they’ll be the last ones driving ICE vehicles in a world where it is cleaner and more efficient to run electric vehicles.”\n",

      "Text: The EU lavished up to €15.7bn in fossil fuel subsidies on its fishing industry over the last decade but campaigners are calling for those funds to be redirected towards decarbonisation. Fuel tax exemptions for the fishing industry save so much money that they could pay the salaries of 20,000 fishers every year – or pay for 6,000 new energy reduction and decarbonisation projects, according to an analysis. Europe’s fishing fleet emitted at least 56m tonnes of CO2 between 2010 and 2020, more than twice as much as Malta over the same period, the paper says. But a true figure would be much higher, with studies indicating that practices such as bottom trawling release as much CO2 as the entire aviation industry. Even so, Europe’s fishing vessels – like its aircraft – pay no fuel taxes at present. “Vast sums of money could be put to use for good fisheries performance,” said one of the report’s authors, Dr Laura Elsler. “The data clearly shows that by supporting the biggest emitters, fuel subsidies stand in the way of a transition to low-carbon fisheries.” The EU could generate €681m a year if its fishing fleet was taxed at 33 cents a litre, and €1.4bn if it paid the 67 cents a litre average rate charged to road transport users, the study says. Switching tax streams to fund a decarbonisation push would help the EU “shift from unsustainable and unprofitable fishing to income-supporting and environmentally sound use of public money”, added the report co-author, Dr Maartje Oostdijk, a researcher at the University of Iceland. The EU says it is committed to phasing out fossil fuel subsidies but an energy tax review under its Green Deal proposes only an ultra-low industry tax rate of 3.6 cents a litre for fishing vessels. Even this tax band – described as “preposterously low” by the study – is being opposed by fishing countries including France, Spain and Cyprus, which want the sector to continue paying no taxes. Daniel Voces de Onaíndi, the director of the Europêche fishing industry association, said EU fishers had cut their greenhouse gas emissions by half since 1990. “We are not waiting for NGOs to initiate this path,” he said. “However, given the lack of alternative propulsion technologies or net zero carbon fuels, fuel oil taxation will not drive any transition to decarbonisation. It will only penalise the sector and even more under the [current] unprecedented fuel prices.” The European Commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Campaigners say revenues raised from a gradually imposed fuel tax could be used to fund the research and rollout of alternative technologies for fishing boats such as wind-assisted propulsion, batteries and green hydrogen systems. The report also proposes decarbonisation projects to, for example, electrify harbours for shoreside power and provide more fuel-efficient fishing gear that reduces bycatch. “The EU fishing industry faces the dual challenge of climate change and overharvesting,” it says. “Therefore, any investments to reduce carbon emissions must replace – not increase – fishing industry capacity.” Depleted fish populations also cause greater emissions because fishing boats have to sail further out to sea for longer periods to catch the same amount of fish. The US on Tuesday signed up to a World Trade Organization agreement committing to end subsidies for vessels involved in overfishing, or the fishing of species whose conservation status is unknown. Flaminia Tacconi, a fisheries lawyer for the green legal group ClientEarth, said it was true that EU fishing vessels had already reduced their fuel emissions, but only “because there were way too many subsidised boats for far too few fish and the sector had to adjust to reality”. She added: “Keeping these fuel subsidies would be a schizophrenic approach if, on the one hand, you ask the sector to move away from fossil fuels and on the other, you continue to finance them through indirect fossil fuel subsidies.” The report says 17 alternative subsidies – covering issues from safety at sea to protecting aquatic species – could outperform the current fuel subsidy for impact by 188% when measured against environmental, social and economic criteria. Rebecca Hubbard, the director of the Our Fish campaign, which commissioned the report, said: “There are so many other things we can do to support the fishing industry with better social, environmental and economic outcomes. Yet the EU has chosen previously – and the fishing industry continues to support – funding fossil fuel companies instead of its own industry. It doesn’t make sense.” A spokesperson for the European commission said: “It is not accurate for the Report to state that Europe spent up to €15.7bn on fossil fuel subsidies to its fishing fleet in the last decade. Our data indicates that the foregone revenue due to the existing tax exemptions amounts to about €1.14 billion annually. Our proposal to revise the energy taxation directive would end this exemption with a harmonised minimum tax rate, which will help to promote energy savings and the reduction of the dependency on fossil fuels in the fisheries sector – and for the rest of the EU economy.”\n",

      "Text: In the world of cosmetics, packaging is king. Who would buy half the products available if it wasn't for the beautiful bottles and boxes they came wrapped in? Lush has long bucked this trend - selling bath bombs and soaps lose, and putting handcreams and body lotions in plain black tubs. It's not always very glamorous but it is greener.  As well as improving existing containers, so they break down quicker after use, the company has introduced a new innovation to its packaging: popcorn. The popcorn is 60% lighter than the shredded paper it uses now, which means it takes 10% less energy to transport. The energy needed to produce the popcorn is on a par with that used to shred the paper, but the popcorn is cleaner so there is not need to wrap the products being transported - a move that Lush says will save 4.6m bags a year. And once you've unpacked the box you can put the popcorn in your compost bin - if you have one - where it will completely breakdown. If you don't yet have a compost, details are included in the box.  Lush says it works brilliantly as a packaging material - it sent a lightbulb in the post six times and it arrived in one piece every time (a Christmas holiday spent working in a sorting office convinces me that this was quite a good test). And it seems to me to be as close to fun as green packaging usually gets - although trying to resist eating it, despite the soapy smell, could be a trial, although it's one way to get round the composting question.  Popcorn seems like such a great idea, it made me wonder why no-one had thought of it before. Apparently they had - a Dutch computer firm did back in 1990, but it doesn't seem to have widely caught on. Will it this time? And are there other green forms of packaging that we're missing out on?\n",

      "Text: The New South Wales government is considering legislation that could limit the ability for planning authorities to rule out coalmines projects based on the climate change impact of emissions from the coal once it is burned. It comes after a campaign from the NSW Minerals Council over decisions that have referenced the impact of “scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions” as a reason for either rejecting a mining project entirely or for imposing conditions on it. For a coalmine, scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are from the burning of the coal after it is sold into the market, including overseas. The planning minister, Rob Stokes, said it was “not appropriate for state governments to impose conditions about emissions policies in other countries”. He said the government was looking at a range of options, including legislation or a new guideline for how planning authorities should factor scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions into the assessment process. The recent decisions include the NSW land and environment court’s rejection of the Rocky Hill coalmine in February, which cited the impact the mine would have on climate change, including through the burning of coal in other countries, at a time when “a rapid and deep decrease” in global emissions was urgently needed. In August, the NSW Independent Planning Commission approved the expanded United Wambo coal project near Singleton but as a condition said the coal could only be exported to countries that have ratified the Paris agreement. In September the commission rejected the development of a greenfield coalmine in NSW’s Bylong Valley, citing the impact the mine would have on groundwater, agricultural land and on climate change. The NSW Minerals Council has since launched attack ads that target the planning system for “failing the people of NSW”. In a statement last week, the council’s chief executive Stephen Galilee said the decision to launch a campaign came after months of “warnings to the minister for planning and others in the government about the risk of the planning system to jobs and investment”. He said the situation had reached “crisis point” with the Bylong Valley decision. Stokes said the Minerals Council was one of the stakeholders the government was consulting in its development of a policy on scope 3 emissions. “We are working with key stakeholders, including the federal government, NSW Minerals Council and consent authorities, to develop a clear policy direction as quickly as possible to provide certainty to the community, industry and investors,” he said. “We are looking at a range of options including legislation.” The consent authorities in this instance include the NSW land and environment court. But environment groups are warning the government not to bow to pressure from the mining industry. Lock the Gate said the impact of downstream greenhouse gas emissions “is arguably the most complicated, severe and lasting environmental impact of NSW’ export coalmines”. Lock the Gate coordinator George Woods said the public should also have a say in how planning decisions address the climate consequences of coal developments and that should be done through a public hearing process run by the independent planning commission. “It’s disappointing and frankly dangerous for the planning minister to narrowly consult only with the mining industry on a matter of profound importance like this,” she said. “The mining industry has flexed its political muscle but the government really needs to address the bigger issue and the public sentiment on this.” Elaine Johnson, the principal lawyer with the Environmental Defenders Office of NSW, which represented Groundswell Gloucester in the Rocky Hill case, said if the government was planning changes to the way planning authorities consider scope 3 emissions, the consultation for that should be broad and include other key stakeholders such as community and environment groups. “The land and environment court, in the Rocky Hill decision, has confirmed that it is entirely appropriate for decision-makers to impose conditions on projects that will contribute to dangerous climate change in a planning context,” Johnson said. She said that was recognised by the independent planning commission in the United Wambo and Bylong Valley assessments. “We would also say that in 2019 we are making planning decisions in a context which includes advice from the world’s best scientists that we’re approaching a climate emergency,” she said. “If global emissions continue to rise and if serious action is not taken at all levels of government, by communities and business, the impacts of dangerous climate change will be catastrophic.” The NSW Minerals Council said recent independent planning commission decisions related to emissions generated in other countries were “inconsistent with the Paris agreement and its associated greenhouse gas accounting framework”. “The NSW government has attempted to clarify its policy on scope 3 emissions through correspondence to the IPC but this has been disregarded,” Galilee told Guardian Australia. “The NSW government must therefore provide legislative and policy certainty on this issue.”\n",

The Swedish teenager now plans to head to Spain to attend the UN climate conference in Madrid. Thunberg hitched a ride from the US with an Australian family on their 48-ft (15-metre) yacht. The white catamaran carrying Thunberg sailed slowly up the River Tagus under blue skies and a stiff breeze. Thunberg’s father, Svante, was also on the boat as it approached the Lisbon quayside. Chile’s environment minister, Carolina Schmidt, saluted Thunberg’s role in speaking out about the threat of climate breakdown. “She has been a leader that has been able to move and open hearts for many young people and many people all over the world,” Schmidt said at the summit in Madrid. “We need that tremendous force in order to increase climate action,.” Thunberg was due to be met in Lisbon by local dignitaries and other activists. Her representatives said they could not confirm when she would travel to the Spanish capital. She wanted a low-carbon form of transport to get to the climate meeting, which was switched at short notice to Spain from Chile due to unrest there. The yacht, named La Vagabonde, leaves little or no carbon footprint when its sails are up, using solar panels and hydro-generators for electricity. Meanwhile, a report by the UN weather agency released on the sidelines of the climate talks has found that this decade is likely to set a 10-year temperature record. Preliminary measurements show the years 201519 and 2010-19 “are, respectively, almost certain to be the warmest five-year period and decade on record”, the World Meteorological Organization said. “Since the 1980s, each successive decade has been warmer than the last.” While full-year figures would not be released until March, 2019 was also expected to be the second or third warmest year since measurements began, with 2016 still holding the all-time temperature record, it said.\n",

      "Text: Last week, a group of respected scientists wrote to the Guardian to argue that using wood to generate electricity in place of coal is not a solution to climate change. Their critique pointed to a “carbon debt” arising from the years between using a tree for fuel and new one growing. They gave the impression that forests are being cleared wholesale to be shovelled into power stations. Reality on the ground is, however, somewhat different. I found this out when earlier this year I went to the USA as an advisor to Drax, a power company in the UK that is seeking to accelerate the phase out of coal by using a biomass instead. On my travels I had many vivid reminders as to how forests are more than collections of individual trees. In the case of the US South, from where much of the wood being used in the UK comes from, I saw vast expanses of production woodlands being harvested for a range of products. I learned that the demand for wood has over recent decades been the main reason why the quantity of wood those forests hold has about doubled. Those managed ecosystems are taking carbon out of the atmosphere, while supplying various industries including, lumber, paper and bioenergy. I saw how, at the level of the landscape, there is no carbon debt. And it is important to know which wood is being made into wood pellets to generate electricity here. Much of the wood produced by these forests is low grade thinnings taken out as part of the process of growing higher grade lumber. These, along with branches and sawmill waste, are the principle sources of materials being made into wood pellets to displace coal. Of course it might be argued that solar and wind are better, but when it’s dark or calm these intermittent renewable sources need to be complemented with sources that can be turned up and down at a moment’s notice. Hydropower and tidal sources can do this but in the UK context have limited potential. Nuclear is another low carbon alternative but is inflexible and if anything is an alternative to wind and solar, rather than a complement to them. A decade ago when I was campaigning for the new laws that eventually became the UK Climate Change Act, I pressed for the urgent slashing of greenhouse gas emissions. Since then we’ve made good progress on renewables deployment, helping to bring about the UK’s first day without coal power since we’ve had electricity – a landmark reached in April this year. Such progress is possible not just because of ambitious determination but also because campaigners have been pragmatic. We showed ministers that it was not just necessary to slash emissions, but also doable. That is why some of us called for conversion of the UK’s biggest power station, Drax, from coal to biomass. There are many questions about biomass (and indeed all energy choices), but in the case of biomass I fear that some advocates have gone from questions to opposition rather too quickly. I stand by the policy I backed a decade ago and would encourage a discussion that seeks to make biomass as a good as it can be, rather than to stop it.  Tony Juniper is an environmentalist, writer and co-founder of the sustainability advisory group Robertsbridge. In that capacity, he has been advising Drax on sustainability issues.\n",

      "Text: Mia Mottley’s speeches in defence of climate justice dominated media headlines at Cop26 in Scotland last year, where she called on world leaders to seize the moment and deliver on climate action. On Monday she tried again. “We have the collective capacity to transform,” she urged those gathered at Cop27 in Egypt. One of the main targets in the sights of Mottley, prime minister of Barbados, is a new finance solution to the climate crisis, which is swiftly becoming one of the key issues being negotiated at the conference. Prof Avinash Persaud, who has been friends with Mottlysince the 1980s when they were both studying at the London School of Economics, worked with her behind the scenes on the financing plan. Persaud believes the global financial system is simply not set up to deliver on the scale needed to avert climate disaster. He says this puts the burden of climate impacts on the world’s poorest countries, those who are “most pressed to act [and] least able to act”. Barbados, one of the Caribbean nations on the frontline of the climate crisis, is a perfect example of this, and the country’s recent experience of Covid-19 also indicates how, without a paradigm shift in the architecture of global finance, natural disasters translate into bigger debt burdens on those who can least afford to shoulder them. “Covid took our debt from 120% of GDP back to 150%, [from] a level that was heading towards sustainability to a level that was not,” says Persaud. The Caribbean is among the world’s most indebted regions, with debt levels averaging 90.1% of GDP since the beginning of the pandemic. Persaud points out that, across the region, climate shocks and debt continue to feed one another in an unhappy downward spiral. “We found that 50% of the increase in our [regional] debt could be traced back to some natural disaster that we had to pay for ourselves,” he says. Persaud was one of the architects of the post-2008 international banking regulation Basel 3, established in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse. This proved to be a strategy for fiscal stability that effectively overturned decades of neoliberal financial orthodoxy. “It was a decade of crisis,” says Persaud. He says the solutions promoted by the IMF and the World Bank, such as currency devaluation and rapid debt reduction, meant emerging markets effectively “doubled down” on their vulnerability, increasing the overall level of instability in the system. “People like myself were arguing that we needed a different financial system,” he says, “but no one listened.” The turning point came with the 2008 global financial crisis where, according to Persaud, “because it involved America and Europe more people became willing to accept that booms and crashes were being amplified by finance and that we needed a more shock-absorbing financial system”. Following the quick succession of two category 5 hurricanes, Irma and Maria, which hit the Caribbean within two weeks of each other in 2017, he saw the threat posed by the growing vulnerability of countries situated on the frontline of climate breakdown and already saddled with debt due to decades of structural adjustment. In Dominica, for example, storm damage from Hurricane Maria alone cost the country more than twice its annual GDP. “Climate is the [economic] crisis of today,” says Persaud. Throughout 2022 Persaud has been working with Mottley to draw up a blueprint for a reformed architecture that would speak as poignantly to the leaders of global finance as to communities living on the frontlines of climate breakdown. The evolving proposals, called the Bridgetown Agenda, have seen the pair make inroads into organisations as diverse as the IMF and the Climate Vulnerable Forum, while also winning the support of key figures, including the UN climate champions Mahmoud Mohieldin and Nigel Topping, and the leading economists Nicholas Stern and Vera Songwe. Topping says: “We do need more of a Marshall Plan-type mentality, because this is about growing the global economy and growing global economic stability and global prosperity. If we don’t solve this then we have very bad economic and security outcomes.” Central to Barbados’s proposals is the establishment of a climate mitigation trust that would prompt the release of $650bn from the IMF through a mechanism called special drawing rights, which allows members to borrow from each other’s reserves at very low interest rates. Persaud’s calculation is that if the IMF puts up an initial $650bn, it will stimulate private investment by an additional $2tn, which would get significantly closer to the sums that experts say need to be raised to get on track to stop global heating. Additional features of the Barbados initiative include giving climate-vulnerable countries access to low-interest, long-term loans for adaptation, natural disaster clauses in all bank loans, and grants for loss and damage that would be funded by a 2% tax on fossil fuel exports, shifting the burden from the poorest people in the world directly on to the polluters. As questions of climate finance and implementation move centre stage at Cop27, Persaud hopes this blueprint will be recognised as “achievable, practical, as well as meaningful and morally right”. “In Barbados,” he says, “it’s part of our makeup that we don’t beg. So we’re not coming to the world and begging, we’re coming to world and saying, this will make the world a better place for everybody.”\n",

      "Text: Rishi Sunak hopes to extract as much oil and gas from the North Sea as possible, No 10 has said, as it announced 100-plus new drilling licences in a “maxing out” policy that environmental groups said would obliterate the UK’s climate commitments. The plan was also criticised by Chris Skidmore, the Conservative MP who led a review into net zero, who said it was “on the wrong side of modern voters”. Making a visit to Aberdeenshire on Monday, Sunak claimed the move was “entirely consistent with our plan to get to net zero”, telling broadcasters that domestic supplies were significantly more efficient than shipping gas and oil from other countries. Sunak’s junior energy minister, Andrew Bowie, described the proposals for the new North Sea licensing round, unveiled on Monday morning, as “maxing out our oil and gas reserves”, a notion backed by Downing Street. Asked whether a plan to allow new licencees to drill for reserves closer to current projects than previously allowed was an attempt to maximise the amount of oil and gas extracted, Sunak’s press secretary said this was “the definition of the new licensing round”. She said: “The prime minister is firmly of the belief that we should use the resources that we have here at home, first and foremost.” Saying that at least 100 new licences and possibly many more were expected to be awarded from the autumn, the press secretary argued this was “totally compatible” with the goal to achieve net zero by 2050, given fossil fuels would still be needed then, and domestic supplies required less transport. Oxfam’s climate policy adviser, Lyndsay Walsh, said: “Extracting more fossil fuels from the North Sea will send a wrecking ball through the UK’s climate commitments at a time when we should be investing in a just transition to a low-carbon economy and our own abundant renewables.” Mike Childs, the head of policy for Friends of the Earth, said: “Climate change is already battering the planet with unprecedented wildfires and heatwaves across the globe. Granting hundreds of new oil and gas licences will simply pour more fuel on the flames, while doing nothing for energy security as these fossil fuels will be sold on international markets and not reserved for UK use.” Skidmore, a former science minister and advocate of green policies within the Tory party, called the new licences “the wrong decision at precisely the wrong time, when the rest of the world is experiencing record heatwaves”. He said: “It is on the wrong side of a future economy that will be founded on renewable and clean industries, and not fossil fuels. “It is on the wrong side of modern voters who will vote with their feet at the next general election for parties that protect, and not threaten, our environment. And it is on the wrong side of history, that will not look favourably on the decision taken today.” A parallel announcement on carbon capture and storage schemes resulted in the Acorn project in north-east Scotland and Viking in the Humber being picked for development by 2030. It follows two earlier projects having been selected in 2021, one in Humber and Teesside and the other in Liverpool Bay, set to come into use by the mid-2020s. Asked in a morning interview with BBC Radio Scotland how he was travelling to Aberdeenshire, a rather grumpy Sunak, who ended the interview when it reached the five-minute limit imposed by No 10, replied: “I’ll be flying as I normally would.” He then told the Good Morning Scotland presenter Martin Geissler: “If you or others think that the answer to climate change is getting people to ban everything that they’re doing, just to stop people going on holiday, I think that’s absolutely the wrong approach.” The new licence process, overseen by the North Sea Transition Authority, will involve a climate compatibility test, but will have more flexibility than before to drill for reserves close to currently licensed areas. Sunak and his ministers have accused Labour of making the UK more reliant on overseas resources if it goes ahead with a ban on new North Sea projects. Labour says it would invest heavily in renewable sources such as wind, and also in nuclear power, which would reduce bills and make supplies more secure and sustainable.\n",

      "Text: The UK should “mobilise an army of volunteers” to transform the country’s energy landscape and reduce its dependence on Russian fossil fuel by setting up community energy groups, say campaigners. With energy prices rising, local schemes such as solar panels, locally-funded wind farms and even hydroelectric dams could be crucial to helping generate energy. John Taylor, the energy projects manager at Energy Hub, argues that the UK should be convening local groups that can help give advice on grants for insulation and heat pumps, set up community-owned renewable projects, and help with insulation. “Volunteers can be provided with thermal imaging cameras to go door to door,” he suggested. They can help “identify cold spots and installing simple measures like draft proofing and radiator panels. They can also help set heating controls and lower boiler flow temperatures.” He also suggests that community groups can “run a village survey to find out who needs items like DIY loft insulation and draft proofing kits. Then order them wholesale to get bulk discounts and deliver them to a community centre or village hall for people to collect.” Taylor told the Guardian: “When it comes to the climate emergency and the current gas crisis, people don’t just want to be spectators, they want to be involved in the solutions. Next winter is shaping up to be an unprecedented challenge, so it’s vital we insulate and fit renewables to as many homes as possible over the next nine months.” Local authorities and energy hubs have access to government grants for such schemes. Taylor added: “Mobilising an army of volunteers to help find homes who most need help would have an immediate and positive impact; community energy groups can bring that really important element of trust for referring vulnerable people to these official grant programmes.” Unlike other energy businesses, these community schemes are owned by the people who live near the infrastructure, and can profit from the energy provided. “When it comes to larger projects like solar and wind farms, it’s important to remember that community energy groups are businesses like other developers, but they’re democratically owned by the people who will live alongside this new infrastructure,” Taylor explained. “The revenues from power sales stay with those communities and can be reinvested in other services they really need like rural electric buses fuel poverty alleviation, and upgrading schools and community buildings. During the Covid lockdown, Ferry Farm Community Solar in West Sussex donated £40,000 to local food banks.” Infrastructure communities have a stake in could be a more palatable way to reach the onshore renewables targets required to reach net zero by 2050. This is because those who live nearby can profit from them and have a say in how and where they are built. “If communities are empowered to be proactive in designing and developing their own schemes, whether on their own or in partnership with commercial developers, not only will we see a greater acceptance for these schemes, we will see a multiplier/levelling up effect as millions in community benefit funds start flowing into grassroots projects all across the country,” Taylor said. One group of people in Oxford has managed to harness their local river to provide enough hydroelectric energy to power 55 homes a year. However, critics of the government’s policy including the Conservative MP Philip Dunne, who chairs the environmental audit committee, have said the current schemes are not sufficient. This is because energy generated has to be sold back to the grid, rather than used directly to power the nearest homes, which makes the idea less attractive to communities and results in waste. South-east - Enborne Parish Field Solar Farm – a small solar farm on charity-owned land. Original purpose of the charity was to use land to grow firewood to distribute to the poor of the village. Now giving it a modern twist by using sunlight to make electricity instead of firewood. Midlands – Cromford Mill Hydropower – Nottingham city council is working with local people to install a water wheel on the River Derwent, which could power homes with hydroelectric energy. There was a water wheel on this site in 1776, so new technology is meeting historic infrastructure. North-west – Lancaster Cohousing – this nonprofit housing group has homes connected to a community microgrid. Their power is from a 160kW hydroelectric scheme, Halton Lune Hydro, and from 89kWp of roof-mounted solar panels on their roofs, owned by MORE Renewables, another local community energy company.

      "Text: Migratory fish populations have crashed by more than 80% since 1970, new findings show. Populations are declining in all regions of the world, but it is happening fastest in South America and the Caribbean, where abundance of these species has dropped by 91% over the past 50 years. This region has the world’s largest freshwater migrations, but dams, mining and humans diverting water are destroying river ecosystems. In Europe, populations of migratory freshwater fishes have fallen by 75%, according to the latest update to the Living Planet Index. Migratory freshwater fish partially or exclusively rely on freshwater systems – some are born at sea and migrate back into fresh water, or vice versa. They can in some cases swim the width of entire continents and then return to the stream in which they were born. They form the basis for the diets and livelihoods of millions of people globally. Many rivers, however, are no longer flowing freely due to the construction of dams and other barriers, which block species’ migrations. There are an estimated 1.2m barriers across European rivers. Other causes of decline include pollution from urban and industrial wastewater, and runoff from roads and farming. Climate breakdown is also changing habitats and the availability of freshwater. Unsustainable fishing is another threat. Herman Wanningen, founder of the World Fish Migration Foundation, one of the organisations involved in the study, said: “The catastrophic decline in migratory fish populations is a deafening wake-up call for the world. We must act now to save these keystone species and their rivers. “Migratory fish are central to the cultures of many Indigenous peoples, nourish millions of people across the globe, and sustain a vast web of species and ecosystems. We cannot continue to let them slip silently away.” A quarter of freshwater fish species are threatened with extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with migratory fish disproportionately threatened. The report looks at population trends of 284 freshwater fish species. Researchers also noted there could have been substantial declines prior to 1970 but there was no data for this. There was also insufficient data to calculate population changes in Africa, but researchers wrote that many species in that region faced multiple stressors. Previous research has found similar “catastrophic” declines. Authors of the latest report call for better long-term monitoring, rivers to be restored and protected, and the removal of barriers to migration. Researchers want to find renewable energy alternatives to the thousands of new hydropower dams being planned across the world. Last year, a record 487 barriers were removed in 15 European countries. Michele Thieme, deputy director of freshwater for WWF-US, said: “We have the tools, ambition and commitment to reverse the collapse of freshwater fish populations … Prioritising river protection, restoration and connectivity is key to safeguarding these species.” Dr David Jacoby, a zoology lecturer at Lancaster University, said that while the report confirmed widespread concerns about freshwater bodies, “the extent of decline, both regionally and globally, is still shocking”. “The threats posed by barriers to migration, pollution, water abstraction and climate change become cumulative,” he said, adding that the “huge” impact on migratory species and the impact on the fisheries they sustain required increased monitoring to help reconnect freshwater and marine ecosystems. Dr Anthony Acou, of the National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (INRAE) in France, pointed out that, as many species migrating between salt and fresh water spent most of their lives in the sea, it was also important to consider “pressures such as oceanic current modification, decrease of productivity, offshore windfarms, climate change [and] bycatch”. “To preserve/conserve the species, it is critical to better understand the impact of the pressures on both marine and freshwater habitats to enhance our understanding and target efficient management measures,” he said.

      "Text: Excess heat produced across Europe could almost power the entire region but preventing this waste is largely being ignored as a solution to the energy crisis, say environmental experts. “The global energy crisis is a wakeup call to stop wasting energy,” said Toby Morgan, senior manager for the built environment at Climate Group, an environmental not-for-profit. “Now, more than ever, we need to make better use of the energy we already produce, we simply can’t afford to let it literally escape out the window. Energy efficiency improvements, like capturing and recycling excess heat, are absolutely critical to lower fossil fuel demand and lower bills.” A report published this week by the global engineering company Danfoss estimated that in the EU alone, excess heat was equal to 2,860 TWh a year, almost the same as the EU’s total energy demand for heat and hot water. Surplus heat is released into the air from a wide range of sources, including supermarkets, transport networks, data centres and commercial buildings. Much of this can be captured and used via existing heat recovery technologies, such as heat pumps, plus more efficient air conditioners and manufacturing machinery according to the authors of the report. Other solutions include improved urban planning and district energy systems based on networks of renewable energy supplies for both heating and cooling. Brian Vad Mathiesen, a professor in energy planning and renewable energy systems at Aalborg University, led the research cited in the report that builds on his team’s previous Heat Roadmap Europe projects. “The amount of cities, regions and countries in Europe which waste heat while spending billions on natural gas or electric heating is mind-blowing,” said Vad Mathiesen, warning that Europe’s energy security was at stake. “Take the Netherlands – there is virtually no district heating even though there is almost twice the amount of waste heat compared to the heat demand. Denmark is the same size but has towards 60% percent district heating with only one third of the population. The use of waste heat is certainly not connected to technical differences. While the physical laws are the same, the political will and traditions are very different.” There was “huge, unharnessed potential” to the excess heat produced by heavy industry, such as chemical manufacturing, steel and cement production. In the EU, that amounts to more than 267 TWh a year, more than the combined heat generation of Germany, Poland and Sweden in 2021. Data centres are also major consumers of electricity. In 2020, European data centres consumed about 3.5% of the region’s electricity demand, according to ReUseHeat, an EU project that explored barriers to urban heat recovery. The report highlights that the UK has an abundance of excess energy, including from 456 data centres. “That’s third most in the world, just behind Germany and the US,” explains Kim Fausing, the president and chief executive of Danfoss, who believes recycling heat is a crucial step towards a green transition. “If businesses were to harness all the excess heat from these centres, the emissions savings and revenue from selling this heat would be highly significant. In Greater London, we have identified at least 648 eligible excess heat sources, including data centres, underground stations, supermarkets, wastewater treatment plants, and food production facilities. Why aren’t businesses and local government organisations using these?” said Fausing, adding that London’s excess heat equated to 9.5 TWh a year, roughly the amount of heat required to heat 790,000 households. “Reusing excess heat offers incredible opportunities for businesses throughout the UK to reduce their emissions, save money and make money. What are we waiting for?” To rapidly tackle the energy crisis, Vad Mathiesen proposes a heat planning directive that enables local authorities to plan according to local conditions. This would involve mapping existing waste heat sources in greater detail, then proposing thermal networks that distribute heat more effectively and initiatives that improve energy efficiency in buildings. “Energy efficiency needs to be a top priority for any business or government, particularly during an energy crisis,” said Morgan, who advises every corporate net zero commitment to include a time-bound energy efficiency target, and for governments to incentivise the uptake of energy efficient technologies. “Energy efficiency improvements are climate critical. The time for action is now.”\n",

      "Text: Tackling climate change would save at least a million lives a year, the World Health Organization has told the UN climate summit in Poland, making it a moral imperative. Cutting fossil fuel burning not only slows global warming but slashes air pollution, which causes millions of early deaths a year, the WHO says. In a report requested by UN climate summit leaders, the WHO says the economic benefits of improved health are more than double the costs of cutting emissions, and even higher in India and China, which are plagued by toxic air. “The global public health community is getting very impatient,” said María Neira, WHO director of public and environmental health. “If you don’t think you need to take action for the sake of climate change, make sure when you think about the planet you incorporate a couple of lungs, a brain and a heart. It is not just about saving the planet in the future, it is about protecting the health of the people right now.” The damage caused by coal, oil and gas pollution is “outrageous”, she said. “There are words not included in the documents at [the climate summit]: asthma, lung cancer, stroke, heart disease – they need to be incorporated in all the decision-making processes.” “Morally, delaying the [clean energy] transition is being responsible for millions of deaths every year,” Neira said. “[Leaders] need to ask themselves how many deaths are [they] willing to accept. When health is taken into account, climate action is an opportunity, not a cost.” Air pollution is the best known impact of fossil fuel use, and climate change damages health through heatwaves, storms, floods and droughts, increased spread of infectious disease and the destruction of health facilities. Global warming is also damaging crops and reducing their nutritional value, with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization now reporting a rise in the number of hungry people going up after decades of decline. “We now have scientific evidence that people are suffering and dying from climate change,” said Prof Kristie Ebi, at the University of Washington and lead author on the recent intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) report, that warned that the global temperature rise must be kept to 1.5C to protect hundreds of millions of people from harm. Another major recent report concluded that climate change is already a health emergency. Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum, at the World Health Organization and also an IPCC report author, said doctors needed to press hard for climate action: “The health profession is the single most trusted profession in the world.” Just 0.5% of multilateral climate finance is currently going to healthcare, he said. Organizations representing more than five million doctors, nurses and public health professionals from 120 countries have issued a call to action to the climate summit in Poland. “We should no longer be talking about the cost of [cutting emissions], we should talk about the benefits to people’s health of investing in what needs to be done,” Campbell-Lendrum said. “At the moment we pretend that polluting [fossil] fuels are cheap fuels, only because we don’t include the cost of them to our health and economy.” The IMF estimates these subsidies to the fossil fuel industry to be $5tn a year, more than all governments currently spend on healthcare. Almost 200 nations are meeting in Katowice, Poland, for two weeks, aiming to turn the carbon-cutting vision set in Paris in 2015 into a reality, as well as increasing the ambition and speed of action and the funding needed. Current pledges leaving the world on track for a disastrous 3C of warming.\n",

      "Text: For more than four decades the UK contributed to EU-wide environmental lawmaking, but what have these regulations and directives done for us? The nearest data that we have comes from the Netherlands. There, scientists compared two alternative realities for their country: one with no EU laws and a version of today’s reality. European-wide laws began with exhaust standards for cars in the 1970s. Acid rain and forest dieback led to industry regulation and limits for total air pollution that each country could produce. The final step was to set minimum standards for the quality of the air that we all breathe. Without EU laws, particle pollution in Amsterdam, Utrecht, Rotterdam and The Hague would have risen steadily to be about 10 times greater than they are today; only slightly better than cities across China, India and Iran. Average life expectancy across the Netherlands would be about six years shorter; that equates to about 66,000 extra Dutch deaths annually and a health cost of €35bn-€77bn (£30bn-£65bn) a year. The UK is further from some of Europe’s big pollution centres than the Netherlands, but with a population that is four times greater, we can be sure that the impact of EU laws on annual deaths would be larger.\n",

      "Text: US environmental regulators announced on Monday they would ease emissions standards for cars and trucks, saying that a timeline put in place by Barack Obama was not appropriate and set standards “too high”. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it had completed a review that would affect vehicles for model years 2022-25 but it did not provide details on new standards, which it said would be forthcoming. Current regulations from the EPA require the fleet of new vehicles to get 36 miles per gallon in real-world driving by 2025. That’s about 10 miles per gallon over the existing standard. The agency said in its decision that the regulation set under the Obama administration “presents challenges for auto manufacturers due to feasibility and practicability, raises potential concerns related to automobile safety, and results in significant additional costs on consumers, especially low-income consumers”. The EPA, in partnership with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, will work to come up with new standards. Automakers applauded Monday’s decision, arguing that the current requirements would have cost the industry billions of dollars and raised vehicle prices due to the cost of developing the necessary technology. “This was the right decision, and we support the Administration for pursuing a data-driven effort and a single national program as it works to finalize future standards,” said Gloria Bergquist, vice president of communications and public affairs for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, in a statement. “We appreciate that the Administration is working to find a way to both increase fuel economy standards and keep new vehicles affordable to more Americans.” Environmentalists, meanwhile, warned the proposed rollbacks would make American cars more expensive to fill up. “No one in America is eager to buy a car that gets worse gas mileage and spews more pollution from its tailpipe,” said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund. “Designing and building cleaner, more cost-efficient cars is what helped automakers bounce back from the depths of the recession and will be key to America’s global competitiveness in the years ahead.” Any change is likely to set up a lengthy legal showdown with California, which has the power to set its own pollution and gas mileage standards and doesn’t want them to change. About a dozen other states follow California’s rules, and together they account for more than one-third of the vehicles sold in the US. Currently the federal and California standards are the same. Some conservative groups are pressing the EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, to get rid of the waiver. Pruitt said in a statement Monday that the agency will work with all states, including California, to finalize new standards. “Cooperative federalism doesn’t mean that one state can dictate standards for the rest of the country,” he said. “EPA will set a national standard for greenhouse gas emissions that allows auto manufacturers to make cars that people both want and can afford – while still expanding environmental and safety benefits of newer cars.” The California attorney general, Xavier Becerra, said his team was reviewing the EPA’s determination and working closely with the California air resources board. “We’re ready to file suit if needed to protect these critical standards and to fight the Administration’s war on our environment,” Becerra said in a statement. “California didn’t become the sixth-largest economy in the world by spectating.” The Massachusetts senator Edward J Markey said the existing standards were “technically feasible and economically achievable”, and added that he would use every legislative tool to block the moves. “Slashing these standards would amount to turning the keys to our energy policy over to big oil and the auto industry,” said the Democrat, who is a member of the environment and public works committee and chair of the Senate climate action taskforce. According to Markey, the standards are projected to save nearly 2.5m barrels of oil a day by 2030, about as much oil as is imported from Opec countries every day.\n",
